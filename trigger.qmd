## ‚ÑπÔ∏è README:

<br>"It's only a theory" is a phrase wrong enough to make a grown physicist cry. Theories, laws, facts, proof, truth are all related verses in a compliated song and while we scientists know what we mean...it's confusing. You see, we've got two problems: we use language and we're human. Scientists converse in everyday terms. Like normal people. But while we use normal words in real life, some of them are different in scientific life.  

As for crying? Years ago I was triggered by a long argument in the state of Florida.

:::

Around 2008 the Florida State Board of Education was grappling with their grade of "F" in a national review of science education. And, of course instructions to teachers on how to teach evolution was a major issue. A few states insisted on teaching creationism, or the cloak-and-dagger idea of "Intelligent Design," along side of, or in place of actual science.

So after many, many hearings, reports, testimony from Nobel laureats, and very public disputes, The fuss was resolved by mandating that whenever evolution was mentioned, it was to be referred to as the **Theory** of Evolution. By contrast, whenever Newton‚Äôs rule regarding gravity was used, it was to be called Newton‚Äôs **Law** of Gravitation. Law, good. Theory? Notsomuch. Remembering this story is why I have on my unhappy face right now.[^law]

> üòê That triggered me and I never taught introductory physics the same after that. 

So I have rules (for myself) and in physics classes that I teach that can be summed up as:

## There are no scientific Laws.

The obvious implication of the Florida stalemate is that somehow a theory is less than a law, less believable, less trustworthy, less true, less factually correct. This is demoralizing for us physicists since it can lead to  misunderstanding about what science can and cannot do. After thinking about this for many years I have reached a set of conclusions about the Nature of Science[^nos]

[^nos]: The Nature of Science is a term of art in some parts of science education research. Everyone has a slightly different take on the "NOS" and I have mine.

Just to be clear...it is after all my blog üòé ... I will not use the word "Law" when I describe scientific ideas.

> **Wait.** What about Newton‚Äôs Laws of motion? <br><br>
> **Glad you asked.**  I will talk about historical scientific ideas which got labeled as "Law" but I'll use "law." So: Newton's Second <u>law</u>. Just to make the point, that law is not always correct since it was superceded by Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity. Some "Law"! See that modern use: It's universally the *Theory of Relativity*, not Law of Relativity,

There are other words and phrases that deserve a scientific explanation and here are seven of them. Follow the links for more discussion. Please!

1. There are no Scientific Laws. <a href="./musings/20250502_0100-laws/0100-laws.qmd" target="_blank">laws</a> 
2. Scientific knowledge is a unique and reliable kind of knowledge. <a href="././musings/20250502_0200-knowledge/0200-knowledge.html" target="_blank">knowledge</a>
3. Facts change and there is no scientific Truth.
4. Theories cannot be proven.
5. It is not possible to test a theory. We test models.
6. There is a reality ‚Äúout there‚Äù and our understanding of it continuously improves.
7. Science is what scientists do.

Squirming yet? I'll speak to each of these in separate posts which will be tagged "NOS" so you can find them. Here, I'll just skim.



## It is not possible to test a theory. We test models.

I‚Äôve discarded Laws and truth and proof and so it‚Äôs time to confront the idea of a theory and how we can trust one or not. ‚ÄúWhat is a theory,‚Äù is a valid question.


### Planes, Trains, and Automobiles: Models

When I was a kid, I was consumed by models of cars‚Äî ‚Äúhot rods‚Äù of the 1960s. And airplanes. And HO train sets. In short, life-like replicas of transportation tools were my passion when I wasn‚Äôt playing or watching baseball.

A plastic model stands for‚Äîrepresents‚Äîa real thing in the world, not perfectly, but well enough to complete a mission. In my case, that mission was a 13 year old boy imagining the car that he‚Äôd work on and own some day. If my plastic 1967 Chevy with baby moon wheels, GM 350 cubes with aluminum heads, Edelbrock intake manifold, Holley 4bbl, HPC Coated Headers w/Dual Exhaust, painted baby blue was made more and more precise, it would eventually become...a real car.

I‚Äôve been careful in what I wrote above to do two things. First, I referred to scientific **statements** and **models** of nature. Gone are the days when a physicist can construct a mathematical description of say a block of wood sliding down a plane of wood and proudly proclaim that what‚Äôs written in symbols on paper is a 1:1 faithful reproduction of what happens in the laboratory.

Now we operate from a more hazy, removed vantage point. As we get into electric and magnetic fields, relativity, and quantum mechanics the correspondence between a mathematical description and what nature is supposed to be like will become necessarily more indirect and abstract.

I now tend to think of a theory as a broad framework within which there are many ways to address nature from within the framework. But what we don‚Äôt do is test the theory, rather we build mathematical models that use the rules (from within the framework) of a theory to address a particular, well-defined piece of nature with predictions. Then experiments are done to test the model, not the theory.

Let‚Äôs pick on Special Relativity again. I can tell you the Theory of Relativity in these three lines:

1. The rules of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.
2. The speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference. 
3. The interval between two spacetime events is Minkowskian.

The first two statements are called the Postulates of Relativity and the last statement is a consequence of the mathematization of the theory in geometry. 

This is the Theory of Relativity‚Ä¶the framework within which any scientific statement must fit. You don‚Äôt need to understand what these sentences mean, but you can surely see that they don‚Äôt contain a single mathematic equation. That‚Äôs where the models come in. 

In my way of thinking, a mathematical model of nature is a little machine that you a result at the end when you add some information at the beginning. The result can be, and usually is, the prediction of what an experiment would find. That result can also be another equation, distilled from input equations. 

We will use the Theory of Relativity above quite a bit, but our confrontation with nature will be through models that are built within the framework of the Theory of Relativity. 

An important aspect of a model is that it must respect a possible measurement‚Äôs capabilities. A model is not meant to be a 1:1 representation of nature, just like the model car is not a real car. It‚Äôs a limited representation that can be tested. Here‚Äôs what I mean.

I can create a model for how fast a block will move across a table if it‚Äôs pushed with a given force. If that‚Äôs all I want to know, that‚Äôs a pretty easy thing to predict. But notice that it‚Äôs not the whole story of what goes on. The table and the block heat up and so energy is lost to the warming air. There are billions of little, complex atomic bonds between the under-surface of the block and the table-top. There‚Äôs a lot of physics involved in describing this event and how much detail I include in the model depends on a) what I want to know from my measurement and b) how well I need to know it. My model could include all of those thermodynamic and atomic effects but I wouldn‚Äôt include them if I can‚Äôt measure the speed very precisely. 

Physicists learn to stick to the Goldilocks Rule of Modeling. A model can‚Äôt be too crude and a model can‚Äôt be too precise‚Ä¶a model needs to be Just Right.


To summarize: 

* accept a theory and its rules; build mathematical models within the theory to represent nature (but not in a 1:1 sense); 
* make predictions from those models and test them in experiments; 
* accept or reject the model based on the results of the experiments. 

That‚Äôs the game that I‚Äôve played for four decades in which I‚Äôve never left the theory of quantum mechanics, the theory of special relativity, nor the theory of general relativity...but I‚Äôve tested lots of models.

#### Statements

It‚Äôs a detail, but an important one. We cannot test nature directly. We can only assess the truth or falsity only of statements. This reflects a remoteness of a scientist relative to nature itself. So a prediction and a test of that prediction is really testing statements and not theories and not nature. I confess this is hard to appreciate and I can probably argue even with myself about it.

### Memory Medicine: Confirmation and Disconfirmation

In my car I just heard an advertisement for a supplement that would make me remember things better. (I don‚Äôt remember its name...see what I did there?) It apparently has been ‚Äúproven‚Äù to be effective. Well, by now you know my problems with that word, but what is it that scientists can actually say about a model and indirectly, the theory framework within which it functions?

The black squirrel issue makes it clear that proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that an inductive model is true is risky and historically unproductive. 

* The word that we use when evidence supports a model‚Äôs prediction is "*confirm*"...the model‚Äôs prediction is *confirmed*, definately not ‚Äúproved.‚Äù 
* The word we use when a model‚Äôs prediction is contradicted is "disconfirmed.‚Äù
* The burden of any model is that it must be "falsifiable" or in principle be disconfirmable. 

A couple of notes. ‚ÄúConfirm‚Äù is weaker than prove, leaving us the necessary freedom to allow that evidence can change our models and even theories. Those theories that I keep saying we trust? They have been confirmed many, many times. (It‚Äôs fair to think that maybe a Law is just a really, well-confirmed theory. But I‚Äôm fighting that older picture of Newtonian-like Laws.) 

That last bullet is important and has a special place in the Philosophy of Science‚Äîand is the center of a couple of serious arguments in my fields of physics right now. <aside class="myaside">You might have heard some of this in the news and the falsifiability test of a theory (the word used then) is attributed to the philosopher, **Karl Popper**. He thought this was a worthy goal of science because showing something to be wrong is actually a deductive process, the inverse of showing that something agrees.</aside>

To a Popperian (my pejorative word) a single instance of disconfirmation should eliminate a model from study (they would say "theory"). A single black squirrel? That‚Äôs nice sounding, but not how science actually works and is philosophically troublesome (ask Mr Google about the Duhem‚ÄìQuine thesis)‚Äìthat black squirrel could have just been in a dust-bin. 

<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">The requirement of falsifiability as a standard required of science has pretty much stuck with us. </p>

Can you see how this in-principle falsifiability requirement actually feeds my original assertion above about how to tell if a statement is scientific or not? The latter is just a simpler version of the former.

The bottom line here is this:

<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">The burden on science is not to prove things about nature, but to confirm or disconfirm statements about nature. </p>

In QS&BB, we‚Äôll watch revolutions in science that create large frameworks in which models are tested, rejected, and accepted. These frameworks I will call *theories* and I can list them for you:

1.  Newton‚Äôs laws of motion (remember?)
2.  Newton‚Äôs law of Gravitation
3.  Maxwell‚Äôs Theory of Electromagnetism
4.  Quantum Mechanics
5.  Special Relativity Theory
6.  The General Theory of Relativity

In my picture, there are not many theories in physics. 

Other topics like the big bang? quarks? nuclear physics? the standard model of particle physics? These are all models within the currently acceptable theories (frameworks) of 4, 5, and 6 above. Numbers 1 and 2? They‚Äôve been replaced!

### Laziness: Belief

One more word that both has no place in science but is one of those words we use all the time: **Belief.** We all talk about what we believe (and don‚Äôt), and scientists will sometimes colloquially do that in a scientific context, but that‚Äôs sloppy. When I say ‚ÄúI believe in X,‚Äù what I really mean is that that job that word does is act as a shorthand for the sentence: ‚ÄúX is highly confirmed by experiments and X is likely to survive foreseeable experimental tests if asked.‚Äù If I‚Äôm an expert in the field of X, then I have the obligation to describe those experimental tests. If I‚Äôm not an expert in X and I want to echo an expert‚Äôs "belief," I should expect that expert could also enumerate its experimental successes in detail on my behalf. (That‚Äôs a little tricky.)

There are dos and don‚Äôts here for scientists (and students of science). When it comes to belief in a scientific statement, I can‚Äôt do three things: 

1. I can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because I want to, 
2. I can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because my gut or a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù suggests that I should, and 
3. I can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because just because a non-expert or an authoritative text tells me to. Likewise, I can‚Äôt say that I *don‚Äôt* believe in X for any of those same three reasons.


## There is a reality ‚Äúout there‚Äù and our understanding of it continuously improves.

For more than a decade, there has been a famous war between philosophers and physicists with prominent physicists claiming that little or none of what philosophers of science have said has had any effect on science. The Nobel physicist from the University of Texas, Stephen Weinberg is both a prolific scientist, but also a writer of non-specialist books, the most famous being *The First Three Minutes*. One of his later books for the public is *Dreams of a Final Theory* and his last chapter is called *Against Philosophy* where he notes, ‚ÄúI know how philosophers feel about attempts by scientists at amateur philosophy. But I do not aim here to play the role of a philosopher, but rather that of a specimen, an unregenerate working scientist who finds no help in professional philosophy. I am not alone in this; I know of no one who has participated actively in the advance of physics in the postwar period whose research has been significantly helped by the work of philosophers.‚Äù

One of the more disturbing ways in which philosophy of science has drifted is in the denial of the project of science as learning about the physical world. Rather, science is deemed to be a social activity without the ability 

## Science is what scientists do.

## Scientific knowledge is a unique kind of knowledge.



What you'll see is that in a very subtle and surprising way, **science is contingent**. Evidence can lead to the overthrow if previously trusted theories. Facts can lose their permanence, proof is impossible except in mathematics, and models are meant to be tested, revised, and tested again. 

Doesn't this go against the common notion that science is the final arbiter of truth? It's complicated and when this contingency meets a unique pandemic and scientists are building the airplane while they're flying it, in public, misunderstanding can be the result.
