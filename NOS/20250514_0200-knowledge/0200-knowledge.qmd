description: "‚ÑπÔ∏è **README:** Many learned treatise have been written to characterize Scientific Knowledge. There's something different about it than everyday knowledge which is easy to say...but hard to describe. I'll try here with my take on this that's decidedly not learned but I think I could defend it. I know when I or a colleague am behaving scientifically and that the knowledge we've produced is legitimately scientific, but isn't it interesting that it's hard to describe?"

# A kind of knowledge?

Characterizing ‚Äúkinds of knowledge‚Äù is a deep subject in psychology and philosophy and I won‚Äôt go there. But I can describe the kind of knowledge we care about ‚Äì Scientific Knowledge ‚Äì¬†and roughly contrast it with our everyday picture of what it means to know something. 

Broadly, I think of day-to-day knowledge as in a few forms: knowledge of things‚Äîhow they appear, how many there are, how they behave; personal knowledge‚Äîlike how I drive a car; and social knowledge‚Äîwhat others tell me, like their names or preferences.[^piaget]

[^piaget]: This is similar to Piaget‚Äôs three kinds of knowledge: Physical, Social, and Logico-mathematical.

Knowledge of things can often be recorded‚Äîwritten down, sketched, or tabulated. Personal knowledge is harder to share; it‚Äôs tied to experience but also internal imagery. Social knowledge is public, transferable, and sometimes prone to misunderstanding.

How do I defend these different types of knowledge? I might compare a book cover to a stoplight to demonstrate that it‚Äôs red, or to the lawn to show it‚Äôs green. That‚Äôs factual demonstration. I might say the red book is my favorite‚Äîpersonal persuasion‚Äîor argue that I "just know" that the green one will also be good, extrapolating from my own experience. I might even say, ‚ÄúMy wife says the green book is good,‚Äù which is persuasion by authority. Some people will claim that they "just know X is true," in spite of evidence which drives me crazy. Each is a distinct way of backing a claim to knowledge.

Our everyday knowledge is pretty fluid. We can change our minds, althought there can be some personal knowledge of political or spiritual belief that's unchangable. 

# Five characteristics of scientific knowledge

Scientific knowledge has aspects of all of these everyday life experience, but it's somehow different. Here's my take on this.

1. **Domain**. Scientific knowledge works within defined boundaries. We study, explain, and predict events in the natural world. The physical world as opposed to a mental or supernatural realm.

2. **Rules**. Scientific knowledge follows some rules and has a handful of commitments which are not under question. The commitments are: 

   1. there is a physical world independent of our minds; 
   2. that world is not capricious but behaves consistently in all places and times, or evolves in understandable ways;  
   3. that world is knowable; 
   4. there are no boundaries of what we can know of that world;
   5. cause and effect operate in that physical world; and 
   6. that world must be described in terms of mathematics.

3. **Public**. Scientific knowledge is public and reproducable. 

   * Scientific knowledge is worthless if it's a secret. This leads to endless arguments about people who had private competing ideas to those who are now credited. Look up Thomas Harriot and Galileo.
   * Scientific knowledge largely builds on trusted theories and facts from the past. A theory parachuted in without any connection to history is not scientific knowledge. It's a guess.
   * Scientific knowledge is a product of people, either working together or historically connected through a chain of evidence and theory. 

4. **Expertise**. Promulgating something that you found on the internet or youtube is not scientific knowledge. Scientific expertise is required before ideas or theories are worth listening to. 

   The flip side of this is **Authority**. Judging scientific statements as true because an authority claimed them so is not scientific. Authority should not matter, evidence should. History is littered with examples of unknown scientitists going up against authority scientists...and winning. Look up Alexander Friedmann and Albert Einstein. Not the latter's best moment.

5. **Two jobs**. A scientific statement must explain events in the physical world, predict events in the physical world...or both.

   * An explanation must be a mathematical model
   * A prediction must be a quantitative or existential statement

6. **Precision**. This point is often underappreciated and runs counter to how we usually accept knowledge. In science, saying ‚ÄúI measured A and its value is $x$‚Äù is unscientific. The proper scientific statement is: ‚ÄúI measured A and its value is $x \pm \delta x$.‚Äù That uncertainty‚Äî$\delta x$‚Äîis essential and must be explicitly stated and justified. Typically, it includes at least two of three components: statistical uncertainty (e.g., the ‚Äúmargin of error‚Äù in polls), systematic uncertainty (how well your instruments perform), and sometimes theoretical uncertainty (from models or simulations underlying the measurement).

   Statistical uncertainty is straightforward: more measurements (e.g., 1000 vs. 10) generally yield more precise results, typically expressed in standard deviations. Systematic uncertainty reflects limitations in measurement tools‚Äîusing a ruler marked only in inches makes it hard to claim 1/10th-inch precision. Theoretical uncertainties arise when the measurement depends on models, common in particle, nuclear, and astrophysics, especially when simulating detectors or signals above background.



## How they differ from everyday knowledge

First of all, everyday knowledge production doesn't adhere to strict rules, so that's an obvious difference with scientific knowledge. Rules-based knowledge that's not science is probably the Law. What you say, how you say it, and how you justify it is pretty much the whole game for the legal profession.

üëâ For me, I think that #6 above is key. It removes "proof" and "truth" from the game since everything you assert must come with an uncertainty. There's no analog to this in everyday knowledge production and consumption.
