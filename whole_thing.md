## ‚ÑπÔ∏è README:

<br>"It's only a theory" is a phrase wrong enough to make a grown physicist cry. Theories, laws, facts, proof, truth are all related verses in a compliated song and while we scientists know what we mean...it's confusing. Scientists converse in everyday terms. Like normal people. But while we use normal words in real life, some of them are different in scientific life.

As for the crying? Years ago I was triggered by a long argument in the state of Florida.

Around 2008 the Florida State Board of Education was grappling with their "F" grade in a national review of science education. And, predictably instructions to teachers on how to teach evolution was a major issue. A few states insisted on teaching creationism, or the cloak-and-dagger idea of "Intelligent Design," along side of, or in place of actual science.

So after many, many hearings, reports, testimony from Nobel laureats, and very public disputes, The fuss was resolved by mandating that whenever evolution was mentioned, it was to be referred to as the **Theory** of Evolution. By contrast, whenever Newton‚Äôs rule regarding gravity was used, it was to be called Newton‚Äôs **Law** of Gravitation. Law, good. Theory? Notsomuch. Remembering this story is why I have on my unhappy face right now.[^law]

> üòê That triggered me and I never taught introductory physics the same after that.

So I have rules (for myself) and in physics classes that I teach that can be summed up as:

## There are no scientific Laws.

The obvious implication of the Florida stalemate is that somehow a theory is less than a law, less believable, less trustworthy, less true, less factually correct. This is demoralizing for us physicists since it can lead to misunderstanding about what science can and cannot do. After thinking about this for many years I have reached a set of conclusions about the Nature of Science (NOS)1

Just to be clear...it is after all my blog üòé ... I'll not use the word "Law" when I describe scientific ideas.

> **Wait.** What about Newton‚Äôs Laws of motion? <br><br> **Glad you asked.** I will talk about historical scientific ideas which got labeled as "Law" but I'll use "law." So: Newton's Second <u>law</u>. Just to make the point, that law is not always correct since it was superceded by Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity. Some "Law"! See that modern use: It's universally the *Theory of Relativity*, not Law of Relativity,

There are other words and phrases that deserve a scientific explanation and here are seven of them, followed by a snapshot of what I have in mind for each. Follow the links for more discussion. Please!

Squirming yet? Each of the above is a separate post tagged "NOS" so you can find them.

## About laws.

Science is actually contingent by purpose and practice. That is, no scientific statement or set of rules are permanent but always subject to overrule. Hence, no Scientific Laws.

## About knowledge.

We all "know" things in everyday life. I know where I left my keys. My personal belief is that I left them...there üëá. If I go there and don't find my keys then either I was wrong, or someone moved my keys. While frustrated, I recognize that I *can* be wrong about my personal knowledge and I have personal strategies to figure out how to find a lost item. My strategies are mine. Yours are yours. A standard acceptable kind of knowledge of key-finding isn't necessary.

But scientific knowledge is a little different. First of all, scientists need to agree on facts and theories. I wouldn't tell you that your way of finding your lost keys is the wrong way, but scientists disagree all the time about whether a path to a conclusion is properly scientific. There is a loose community-acceptable kind of scientific knowledge.

One thing about scientific knowledge is that it's expressed in a language made up of words, images, and mathematics. Statements in this language are constructed to represent phenomena in the physical world. There's the world out there and there's our incomplete knowledge of the features of that world, so we represent it according to our needs and our capabilities. Take baseball.

I can represent a baseball game many ways, from a minimal representation of the outcome to a maximal detailed description of every pitch, the wind velocity, the groundscrew's cutting of the grass, to the amount of Turface Quick Dry‚Ñ¢ used on the mound, to how the field was raked, and the precise height of the outfield walls. If all you need is a quick result, then the final score, runs, hits, and errors is the minimal represention of the game. Want more detail? Then the line score of runs scored every inning is a representation. The Box Score tells you what every player did during the game. 

You represent the game according to the needs of the audence. Mind you, no representation is the actual game itself. 

Learning how to represent the world using scientific statements and how to evaluate scientific statements is an important part of learning to be a physicist. That "representation" is indirect, it's not the thing. The "sky is blue" is a word-statement. The frequency of the light in that sky overhead is about 750 nanometers is a mathematical statement. A spectrographic display is an image statement. None of these are the actual phenomenon, nor are they an explanation of what caused the phenomenon. They are facts and our knowledge of them is limited to how well we can support each of the statements as they all have uncertainties.

## About theories

As my Florida story suggests, just what a theory is can be complicated. It's not a "I woke up this morning and had a hunch" kind of thing and it's certainly not an indisputable kind of thing. Theories are somewhere...in the middle.

But theories are also a pubic thing. Scientists need to agree on what a theory is and when an idea has become a theory. 

I think of theories as frameworks, not recipes or 

## About facts.

Perhaps by now you know that I'm not a fan of proving anything in science! If I prove a mathematical derivation, it's permanent. Within the rules of mathematics, it cannot be wrong and will be...forever. But I've already been adamant about the lack of "Laws" in science so a proof is obviously not my favorite idea.

That's a principled stand but there's a more practical side that argues against proof. What about a fact? It seems reasonable to imagine that I can make a measurement and establish a fact, even *prove* a fact. A fact can be an existence-thing and it can be a number.

Let me take the second first. Here's a fact: the mass of an electron is $9.109 \times 10^{31}$ kg. I measure that and so will you. It's in books. It's in Wikipedia!

But this will sound silly, but it's maybe one of the most important and most misunderstood things about a scientific fact. If you go an measure the mass of an electron, you might get $9.1093837139 \times 10^{31}$ kg. Those aren't the same number. You might correctly point out that they're close and that the second one is maybe more precise and you'd be right. But what then is the proof of the fact that the electron has a *particular* mass? My fact is then not your fact and we can't prove personal facts and still be scientific.

But there's more. If I were to measure the mass of the electron and report it as "$9.1093837139 \times 10^{31}$" I'd lose my physicist union card. All...every single one...measurement of a physical "fact" is not just a number. It's a number plus a declaration of how well I know that number...the "uncertainty." Thankfully now when political polls are announced, the "margin of error" is reported. So if one candidate's poll number is 49% and the other is 51% with a margin of error of 4%...they are tied. Nobody can be reported to be ahead.

The same thing is true in a scientific "fact" but besides the uncertainty inherent to the number of measurements (statistical uncertainty), there are uncertainties inherent to the measurement device used. If I have a ruler marked off in only whole inches, and I measure something to be 2.5 inches long, then there's an inherent uncertainty in that measurement that's a significant fraction of an inch.

So. Facts about the natural world cannot be proven in the same sense that a mathematical proof can be proven. So when being precise in our language, scientists do not speak of having proven a fact.

## About theories: tests

üîê Science by yourself and only in your head is not professional science. That is, science is public and how we communicate is through scientific statements. So really when one is evaluating the believability of a scientific idea...what you're really evaluating is a set of statements about that idea. In everyday life, I might toss off a thought casually, without preparation or much analysis. You know, like in a normal conversation. But a scientific statement isn't like that. It's considered, it's carefully put together, it's thoughtful and meaningful. A scientific statement can be a sentence, or a whole book. The point is that a scientific statement has structure and is composed according to professional expectations.

## It is not possible to test a theory. We test models.

I‚Äôve discarded Laws and truth and proof and so it‚Äôs time to confront the idea of a theory and how we can trust one or not. ‚ÄúWhat is a theory,‚Äù is a valid question.

### Planes, Trains, and Automobiles: Models

When I was a kid, I was consumed by models of cars‚Äî ‚Äúhot rods‚Äù of the 1960s. And airplanes. And HO train sets. In short, life-like replicas of transportation tools were my passion when I wasn‚Äôt playing or watching baseball.

A plastic model stands for‚Äîrepresents‚Äîa real thing in the world, not perfectly, but well enough to complete a mission. In my case, that mission was a 13 year old boy imagining the car that he‚Äôd work on and own some day. If my plastic 1967 Chevy with baby moon wheels, GM 350 cubes with aluminum heads, Edelbrock intake manifold, Holley 4bbl, HPC Coated Headers w/Dual Exhaust, painted baby blue was made more and more precise, it would eventually become...a real car.

chevybox.png intage Revell model ‚Äô57 Chevy. In the box.

I‚Äôve been careful in what I wrote above to do two things. First, I referred to scientific **statements** and **models** of nature. Gone are the days when a physicist can construct a mathematical description of say a block of wood sliding down a plane of wood and proudly proclaim that what‚Äôs written in symbols on paper is a 1:1 faithful reproduction of what happens in the laboratory.

Now we operate from a more hazy, removed vantage point. As we get into electric and magnetic fields, relativity, and quantum mechanics the correspondence between a mathematical description and what nature is supposed to be like will become necessarily more indirect and abstract.

I now tend to think of a theory as a broad framework within which there are many ways to address nature from within the framework. But what we don‚Äôt do is test the theory, rather we build mathematical models that use the rules (from within the framework) of a theory to address a particular, well-defined piece of nature with predictions. Then experiments are done to test the model, not the theory.

Let‚Äôs pick on Special Relativity again. I can tell you the Theory of Relativity in these three lines:

1. The rules of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.
2. The speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference.
3. The interval between two spacetime events is Minkowskian.

The first two statements are called the Postulates of Relativity and the last statement is a consequence of the mathematization of the theory in geometry.

This is the Theory of Relativity‚Ä¶the framework within which any scientific statement must fit. You don‚Äôt need to understand what these sentences mean, but you can surely see that they don‚Äôt contain a single mathematic equation. That‚Äôs where the models come in.

In my way of thinking, a mathematical model of nature is a little machine that you a result at the end when you add some information at the beginning. The result can be, and usually is, the prediction of what an experiment would find. That result can also be another equation, distilled from input equations.

We will use the Theory of Relativity above quite a bit, but our confrontation with nature will be through models that are built within the framework of the Theory of Relativity.

An important aspect of a model is that it must respect a possible measurement‚Äôs capabilities. A model is not meant to be a 1:1 representation of nature, just like the model car is not a real car. It‚Äôs a limited representation that can be tested. Here‚Äôs what I mean.

I can create a model for how fast a block will move across a table if it‚Äôs pushed with a given force. If that‚Äôs all I want to know, that‚Äôs a pretty easy thing to predict. But notice that it‚Äôs not the whole story of what goes on. The table and the block heat up and so energy is lost to the warming air. There are billions of little, complex atomic bonds between the under-surface of the block and the table-top. There‚Äôs a lot of physics involved in describing this event and how much detail I include in the model depends on a) what I want to know from my measurement and b) how well I need to know it. My model could include all of those thermodynamic and atomic effects but I wouldn‚Äôt include them if I can‚Äôt measure the speed very precisely.

Physicists learn to stick to the Goldilocks Rule of Modeling. A model can‚Äôt be too crude and a model can‚Äôt be too precise‚Ä¶a model needs to be Just Right.

To summarize:

- accept a theory and its rules; build mathematical models within the theory to represent nature (but not in a 1:1 sense);
- make predictions from those models and test them in experiments;
- accept or reject the model based on the results of the experiments.

That‚Äôs the game that I‚Äôve played for four decades in which I‚Äôve never left the theory of quantum mechanics, the theory of special relativity, nor the theory of general relativity...but I‚Äôve tested lots of models.

#### Statements

It‚Äôs a detail, but an important one. We cannot test nature directly. We can only assess the truth or falsity only of statements. This reflects a remoteness of a scientist relative to nature itself. So a prediction and a test of that prediction is really testing statements and not theories and not nature. I confess this is hard to appreciate and I can probably argue even with myself about it.

### Memory Medicine: Confirmation and Disconfirmation

In my car I just heard an advertisement for a supplement that would make me remember things better. (I don‚Äôt remember its name...see what I did there?) It apparently has been ‚Äúproven‚Äù to be effective. Well, by now you know my problems with that word, but what is it that scientists can actually say about a model and indirectly, the theory framework within which it functions?

The black squirrel issue makes it clear that proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that an inductive model is true is risky and historically unproductive.

- The word that we use when evidence supports a model‚Äôs prediction is "*confirm*"...the model‚Äôs prediction is *confirmed*, definately not ‚Äúproved.‚Äù
- The word we use when a model‚Äôs prediction is contradicted is "disconfirmed.‚Äù
- The burden of any model is that it must be "falsifiable" or in principle be disconfirmable.

A couple of notes. ‚ÄúConfirm‚Äù is weaker than prove, leaving us the necessary freedom to allow that evidence can change our models and even theories. Those theories that I keep saying we trust? They have been confirmed many, many times. (It‚Äôs fair to think that maybe a Law is just a really, well-confirmed theory. But I‚Äôm fighting that older picture of Newtonian-like Laws.)

That last bullet is important and has a special place in the Philosophy of Science‚Äîand is the center of a couple of serious arguments in my fields of physics right now.

<aside class="myaside">

You might have heard some of this in the news and the falsifiability test of a theory (the word used then) is attributed to the philosopher, **Karl Popper**. He thought this was a worthy goal of science because showing something to be wrong is actually a deductive process, the inverse of showing that something agrees.

</aside>

To a Popperian (my pejorative word) a single instance of disconfirmation should eliminate a model from study (they would say "theory"). A single black squirrel? That‚Äôs nice sounding, but not how science actually works and is philosophically troublesome (ask Mr Google about the Duhem‚ÄìQuine thesis)‚Äìthat black squirrel could have just been in a dust-bin.

<p class="pullquote">

The requirement of falsifiability as a standard required of science has pretty much stuck with us.

</p>

Can you see how this in-principle falsifiability requirement actually feeds my original assertion above about how to tell if a statement is scientific or not? The latter is just a simpler version of the former.

The bottom line here is this:

<p class="pullquote">

The burden on science is not to prove things about nature, but to confirm or disconfirm statements about nature.

</p>

In QS&BB, we‚Äôll watch revolutions in science that create large frameworks in which models are tested, rejected, and accepted. These frameworks I will call *theories* and I can list them for you:

1. Newton‚Äôs laws of motion (remember?)
2. Newton‚Äôs law of Gravitation
3. Maxwell‚Äôs Theory of Electromagnetism
4. Quantum Mechanics
5. Special Relativity Theory
6. The General Theory of Relativity

In my picture, there are not many theories in physics.

Other topics like the big bang? quarks? nuclear physics? the standard model of particle physics? These are all models within the currently acceptable theories (frameworks) of 4, 5, and 6 above. Numbers 1 and 2? They‚Äôve been replaced!

### Laziness: Belief

One more word that both has no place in science but is one of those words we use all the time: **Belief.** We all talk about what we believe (and don‚Äôt), and scientists will sometimes colloquially do that in a scientific context, but that‚Äôs sloppy. When I say ‚ÄúI believe in X,‚Äù what I really mean is that that job that word does is act as a shorthand for the sentence: ‚ÄúX is highly confirmed by experiments and X is likely to survive foreseeable experimental tests if asked.‚Äù If I‚Äôm an expert in the field of X, then I have the obligation to describe those experimental tests. If I‚Äôm not an expert in X and I want to echo an expert‚Äôs "belief," I should expect that expert could also enumerate its experimental successes in detail on my behalf. (That‚Äôs a little tricky.)

There are dos and don‚Äôts here for scientists (and students of science). When it comes to belief in a scientific statement, I can‚Äôt do three things:

1. I can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because I want to,
2. I can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because my gut or a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù suggests that I should, and
3. I can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because just because a non-expert or an authoritative text tells me to. Likewise, I can‚Äôt say that I *don‚Äôt* believe in X for any of those same three reasons.

## There is a reality ‚Äúout there‚Äù and our understanding of it continuously improves.

For more than a decade, there has been a famous war between philosophers and physicists with prominent physicists claiming that little or none of what philosophers of science have said has had any effect on science. The Nobel physicist from the University of Texas, Stephen Weinberg is both a prolific scientist, but also a writer of non-specialist books, the most famous being *The First Three Minutes*. One of his later books for the public is *Dreams of a Final Theory* and his last chapter is called *Against Philosophy* where he notes, ‚ÄúI know how philosophers feel about attempts by scientists at amateur philosophy. But I do not aim here to play the role of a philosopher, but rather that of a specimen, an unregenerate working scientist who finds no help in professional philosophy. I am not alone in this; I know of no one who has participated actively in the advance of physics in the postwar period whose research has been significantly helped by the work of philosophers.‚Äù

One of the more disturbing ways in which philosophy of science has drifted is in the denial of the project of science as learning about the physical world. Rather, science is deemed to be a social activity without the ability

## Science is what scientists do.

## Scientific knowledge is a unique kind of knowledge.

What you'll see is that in a very subtle and surprising way, **science is contingent**. Evidence can lead to the overthrow if previously trusted theories. Facts can lose their permanence, proof is impossible except in mathematics, and models are meant to be tested, revised, and tested again.

Doesn't this go against the common notion that science is the final arbiter of truth? It's complicated and when this contingency meets a unique pandemic and scientists are building the airplane while they're flying it, in public, misunderstanding can be the result.

# Turtles: Theories and Laws

Here‚Äôs an oft-told story about turtles as the bedrock on which the universe is built. It's a story with legs: in arguing his plurality opinion in Rapanos v. United States (a dispute over wetlands and the scope of the Clean Water Act, the jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers, and Environmental Protection Agency), Justice Antony Scalia criticized Justice Kennedy‚Äôs argument in a footnote:

>   **Turtles**
>
>   "...an Eastern guru affirms that the earth is supported on the back of a tiger. When asked what supports the tiger, he says it stands upon an elephant; and when asked what supports the elephant he says it is a giant turtle. When asked, finally, what supports the giant turtle, he is briefly taken aback, but quickly replies,  "Ah, after that it is turtles all the way down.‚Äù[^cwa] 

[^cwa]: This turtle story is also credited to Bertrand Russell, Carl Sagan, Linus Pauling, and many other scientists...and apparently justices.

The turtle story in all of its manifestations is an allegory for infinite regress. Scalia was arguing that there seemed to be no end to regulations.

## Laws?

In the 1970s there was an unpopular national speed limit of 55 mph and the catch-phrase used to encourage compliance was: 'It‚Äôs not just a good idea, it‚Äôs the law.' That‚Äôs one interpretation of a law ‚Äì you can obey or choose not to. But then there is the common expectation for Scientific **Laws**...certain, indisputable, irrefutable statements. Epic in their cosmic importance.

The popular notion of a Scientific Law is a statement that's impossible to dispute: once it‚Äôs discovered, it‚Äôs almost biblical in its permanence. Once you‚Äôve found a Law, man, you‚Äôre done. That‚Äôs it. That Law is way better than a theory. Go do something else.

This "Law" was incorporated into the description of physics following Isaac Newton‚Äôs almost super-human successes. Surely, he‚Äôd uncovered the God-given Laws of Nature and surely uncovering the Laws of Nature is now the goal of science. You‚Äôll see all manner of ‚ÄúLaws‚Äù that follow Newton‚Äôs three Laws of Motion and Newton's Gravitational Law: Snell‚Äôs Law, The First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics, the Law of Reflection, Faraday‚Äôs Law, Ampere‚Äôs Law‚Ä¶and so on, up to the 20th century when we got serious. 

From that point, it‚Äôs Einstein‚Äôs Special Theory of Relativity, Einstein‚Äôs General Theory of Relativity, Quantum Theory, Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau Theory, Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Theory, Relativistic Quantum Field Theory, Inflation Theory, the Big Bang Theory, and so on. Are we just dumber than when all of science was uncovering Laws? No. Rather, around the turn of the 20th century the subtlety of science is was sinking in. But apparently not in Florida. <a href="../../trigger.html" target="_blank">onlytheory</a>

Let me tell you a story.

**The speed of light** 

We'll spend a lot of effort becoming comfortable with Einstein‚Äôs Theory of Relativity. One of its famous, bedrock rules is that the speed of light is the fastest that anything can travel. (BTW, that's technically a "postulate," not a law.) Relativity has been confirmed so many times that we use it as a tool and not a theory to be tested‚Ä¶Florida should call it the Law of Relativity. But we don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the Theory of Relativity. 

>There is an elementary particle called the neutrino that is so light that it travels at almost the speed of light. In 2011 an experiment called Opera in a mountain in northern Italy was under way to measure properties of neutrinos coming from the CERN particle accelerator in Geneva, Switzerland, almost 1000 km away.
>
>In order to be sure of the source of interactions, Opera had a sophisticated GPS system that measured times in Geneva and times in the mountain at a precision better than ¬±0.000000010 seconds (¬±10 nanoseconds). What they found was that the neutrinos appeared to arrive *faster* than the speed of light would allow, apparently violating the Theory of Relativity!
>
>If Relativity were a Law of Nature in the Florida-way, say the ‚ÄúLaw of Relativity‚Äù‚Äîthen the surprising Opera measurement  would have confronted the authority of the Law of Relativity and the scientists would back down: can‚Äôt cross that threshold of Law. But Opera scientists couldn‚Äôt do that. The experimenters worked very hard to redo their analyses and scoured their experimental apparatus for any place that the few nanoseconds might have been missing. 
>
>I was a member of the Physics Advisory Committee at the Fermi National Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois which was running a similar experiment, shooting neutrinos from Illinois to a mine in northern Minnesota. We asked them and learned that they too saw an effect, but they used a conventional GPS and they couldn‚Äôt measure times precisely enough to test Opera‚Ä¶ so we bought them a fancy ‚Äì expensive ‚Äì GPS system so they could check! Meanwhile many alternative explanations around Relativity were proposed to account for the measurement. Many, many. A small theoretical physics industry of alternative ideas.
>
>After a year or so, Opera discovered a subtle, tiny, but flawed optical fiber seating that accounted for the missing few nanoseconds and then were able to conclude that Einstein could rest easy. Meanwhile, Fermilab had a shiny, new GPS system.

You get the important part of this story? Relativity is among the most trusted theories in all of science ‚Äî if anything could be labeled as ‚ÄúLaw‚Äù then this is it! And yet, when faced with an apparent problem, we had to dig deeper.^[That's not to say that there weren't a number of physicists who pooh-pooh'd it as a waste of time.]

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
üìù  The authority of Relativity is not absolute, it‚Äôs not Law-like, but a highly trusted theory.
:::

I was proud of my community during that episode. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to work. There are no Laws of the capital L kind.

## My criterion for a proper scientific statement

I'm treading into waters that force us to think about what is and what isn't a proper scientific process. Historically. that's the problem of demarcating Scientific Knowledge from "pseudo-science" statements. You may have heard that scientific statements must be "falsifiable," an idea often credited to the philosopher of science (and other things), Karl Popper[^Popper] 

[^Popper]: Popper's strict falsifiability is no longer accepted for nuanced reasons (the "Quine-Duhem Thesis") but the sentiment is still a guide and Einstein underscored this in his 1905 Special Relativity paper.

 Here's my personal rule:

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
ü´µ In order for you to assert a statement about the natural world as legitimately scientific, you must be able to say what it would take to change your mind.
:::

> Nobody said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs ignore this evidence because Relativity must be true.‚Äù We all said, ‚ÄúWow. A faster-than-light neutrino signal is probably a mistake but we‚Äôd better spend a year around the world checking it.‚Äù 

üëç Proponents of **scientific statements** can always tell you what evidence would force them to abandon one of their favorite theories, here, a superluminal particle qualifies as one of those pieces of evidence that could in-principle have overthrown Relativity.

üëé Proponents of **unscientific statements** cannot ‚Äì or will not ‚Äì do that. The most obvious contemporary example of unscientific assertions are those that come from creationism or "intelligent design." Unlike the Opera experience, proponents of these systems of belief hold that some parts of their knowledge live in territory that is off-limits for questioning. 

> **Wait.** Why shouldn‚Äôt students be taught both sides of such a disagreement about our origins?
>
> **Glad you asked.** That‚Äôs now called ‚Äúteach the controversy‚Äú and it‚Äôs not appropriate in a science class for two reasons. First, to put creationism in a science class goes against that crucial falsifiability requirement. So it‚Äôs not science. Second, science is not a democracy. There‚Äôs no requirement in how the universe works that it make people happy. It is what it is.

If you believe that "X" cannot be doubted?  Then X may be some form of knowledge, but it's not scientific knowledge.



> **Wait.** What about Newtonian Gravitation! It's used today even to determine satellite and spacecraft trajectories. <br><br>
> **Glad you asked.** A tiny bit of display math can answer that I hope

Here is Newton's Gravitational law (see what I did there? law not Law):

$$F = G\frac{M_1M_2}{R_{12}}$$

In words, this formula says that the force of gravitational attraction between two objects that have masses of $M_1$ and $M_2$ and whose centers are separated by the distance $R_{12}$ is that relationship. Let's look at each piece:

- $G$ is called the gravitational constant (or Newton's constant). It's very hard to measure and as a resut it's the worst measured constant of nature of all. A question of scientific research today.
- $M$ is the mass...which is a very complicated concept. As we speake, we are at work at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland trying to understand *mass*. A question of scientific research today.
- $R^2$ ...that "2" in the formula is a direct consequence of the presumption that we have three dimensions of space. It's a measurable quantity ‚Äì and is not very precisely determined and the notion that we have three and not more spacial dimensions is a question of scientific research today.

So every term in Newton's Gravatation law is uncertain and theoretically of interest. Again, Laws shouldn't do that. 

> **Wait.** So, what can you believe in? <br><br>
> **Glad you asked.** That's an understandable concern for folks who don't do science for a living. We have theories and they are all questionable. We must live in a world that is full of uncertainty and a scientific world where no idea is permanent. I suspect that's uncomfortable for many but it's our lives.

So "theories all the way down" really means that we have a few theories that we trust very well and we don't question them now unless a surprise happens. And we have many theories that are not trusted as much. So not turtles all the way down, but theories of varying degrees of trustworthiness.

# Knowledge

# A kind of knowledge?

"Scientific and everyday knowledge" seem different...but it's actually hard to say why. I know when I or a colleague am behaving scientifically and that the knowledge we've produced is legitimately scientific, but isn't it interesting that it's hard to describe? Characterizing ‚Äúkinds of knowledge‚Äù is a deep subject in psychology and philosophy and I won‚Äôt go there. But I can describe the kind of knowledge we care about ‚Äì Scientific Knowledge ‚Äì and roughly contrast it with our everyday picture of what it means to know something. 

Broadly, I think we have:  a) knowledge of things‚Äîhow they appear, how many there are, how they behave; personal knowledge‚Äîlike how I drive a car; and b) social knowledge‚Äîwhat others tell me, like their names or preferences.[^piaget]

[^piaget]: This is similar to Piaget‚Äôs three kinds of knowledge: Physical, Social, and Logico-mathematical.

Knowledge of things can often be <u>recorded</u>‚Äîwritten down, sketched, or tabulated. Personal knowledge is harder to share; it‚Äôs tied to experience but it also often consists of internal imagery. Social knowledge is public, <u>transferable</u>, but sometimes prone to misunderstanding.

Defending my everyday knowledge doesn't follow rules. If well-meaning, then common sense prevails.  I might compare a book cover to a stoplight to demonstrate that it‚Äôs red, or to the lawn to show it‚Äôs green. That‚Äôs <u>factual demonstration</u>. I might say the red book is my favorite or argue that I "just know" that the green one by the same author will also be good, extrapolating from my own experience. These are opinions. I might say, ‚ÄúMy wife says the green book is good,‚Äù which accepting her authority to defend my opinion. Some people will claim that they "just know X is true," in spite of any evidence which drives me crazy.

Our everyday knowledge is pretty fluid. We can change our minds, althought there can be some personal knowledge of political or spiritual belief that's unchangable. 

# Five characteristics of scientific knowledge

Scientific knowledge has aspects of all of these everyday life experience, but it's somehow different. Here's my take on this.

1. **Domain**. Scientific knowledge works within defined and accepted boundaries. We study, explain, and predict events in the natural world. The physical world as opposed to a mental or supernatural realm.[^baseball]

   [^baseball]: Baseball rules work within the domain of a baseball diamond. Applying them outside of that domain, say on a football field, would not make sense.

   

2. **Commitments**. Unlike everyday knowledge, scientific knowledge comes with some rules and a handful of commitments which are not under question. The commitments are: 

   1. there is a physical world independent of our minds; 
   2. that world is not capricious but behaves consistently in all places and times, or evolves in understandable ways;  
   3. that world is knowable; 
   4. there are no boundaries of what we can know of that world;
   5. cause and effect operate in that physical world; and 
   6. that world must be described in terms of mathematics.

3. **Rules**. Scientific knowledge is public and reproducable. 

   * Scientific knowledge is worthless if it's a secret. This leads to endless arguments about people who had private competing ideas to those who are now credited. Look up Thomas Harriot and Galileo.
   * Scientific knowledge largely builds on trusted theories and facts from the past. A theory parachuted in without any connection to history is not scientific knowledge. It's just a guess and unwelcome in scientific discourse.
   * Scientific knowledge is a product of people, either working together or historically connected through a chain of evidence and theory. 
   * Promulgating something that you found on the internet or youtube is not scientific knowledge. Scientific expertise is required before ideas or theories are worth listening to.
   * The flip side of this is **Authority**. Judging scientific statements as true because an authority claimed them so is not scientific. Authority should not matter, evidence should. History is littered with examples of unknown scientitists going up against authority scientists...and winning. Look up Alexander Friedmann and Albert Einstein. Not the latter's best moment.

4. **Scientific Statements**. A scientific statement must explain events in the physical world, predict events in the physical world...or both.

   * An explanation must come from a mathematical model.
   * A prediction must be a quantitative or existence statement (X exist).

5. **Precision**. This point is often underappreciated and runs counter to how we usually accept knowledge. In science, saying ‚ÄúI measured A and its value is $x$‚Äù is unscientific. 

   o The proper scientific statement is: ‚ÄúI measured X and its value is $x \pm \delta x$.‚Äù That uncertainty‚Äî$\delta x$‚Äîis essential and must be explicitly stated and justified. 

   o Typically, it includes at least two of three components: statistical uncertainty (e.g., the ‚Äúmargin of error‚Äù in polls), systematic uncertainty (how well your instruments perform), and sometimes theoretical uncertainty (from models or simulations underlying the measurement).
   
   *  Statistical uncertainty is straightforward: more measurements (e.g., 1000 vs. 10) generally yield more precise results, typically expressed in standard deviations. 
   
   
   * Systematic uncertainty reflects limitations in measurement tools‚Äîusing a ruler marked only in inches makes it hard to claim 1/10th-inch precision. 
   
   
   * Theoretical uncertainties arise when the measurement depends on models, common in particle, nuclear, and astrophysics, especially when simulating detectors or signals above background.
   



## How they differ from everyday knowledge

First of all, everyday knowledge production doesn't adhere to strict rules, so that's an obvious difference with scientific knowledge. Rules-based knowledge that's not science is probably the Law. What you say, how you say it, and how you justify it is pretty much the whole game for the legal profession.

üëâ For me, I think that #5 above is key. It removes "proof" and "truth" from the game since everything you assert must come with an uncertainty. There's no analog to this in everyday knowledge production and consumption. In fact, polemic everyday knowledge is usually, aggressively certain.



# Truth

# Proof



## Theories cannot be proven.

‚ÄúJust the facts, Ma‚Äôam.‚Äù An iconic catch-phrase uttered by Detective Joe Friday on the 1950‚Äôs crime show, *Dragnet*. Everyone knows what a fact is, right? Well it‚Äôs a fact that Joe Friday never said that line in the TV program, but ask anyone over the age of 60 and chances are that they will agree that it‚Äôs a fact that Detective Friday uttered that line in every episode. But he didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs an urban myth born of a popular 1953 spoof of the program, *Little Blue Riding Hood*. Google it and listen (it‚Äôs only 3 minutes).

"Fact" is another one of those words. You might want to say that science consists of facts arranged in order to support or define theories...or just collect data or artifacts. There‚Äôs an assumption built into that sentiment: on the one hand there are facts about the world and on the other hand, there are opinions about the world and science works hard to separate the two‚Ä¶and reserve ‚Äúfacts‚Äù as the fuel for theories and guard against opinion from influencing that process. That‚Äôs the case. But like Law, this burden given to ‚Äúfact‚Äù sometimes assigns to it the responsibility of being a ‚Äútrue thing.‚Äù But even in everyday life, let alone in nearly every crime novel ever written, facts depend on *evidence* and evidence is a set of informed observations. And observations change, they evolve, or they can be mistaken.

A plausible-sounding, if simplified cartoon of the scientific method might be: evidence $\to$ facts $\to$ Laws. But if Laws are not forever, where in this chain does uncertainty sneak in? Obviously, it‚Äôs that evidence and facts are not permanent. It was a fact that the evidence pointed to the fact that all objects move slower than the speed of light, but when the evidence appeared to change we were prepared to dispute the theory and so Relativity as a Law in the Florida-sense didn‚Äôt fit. 

More appropriate is a chain that goes like: evidence $\to$ facts $\to$ theories. And then depending on the accumulation of the evidence that justify the facts, we have theories we trust a lot and theories we‚Äôre just beginning to get to know. But since evidence is contingent, facts are contingent, and so theories are contingent. Any or all can change and it takes a professional scientist to know when to pull the plug on any one of them.


## It is not possible to prove a theory.

Okay, if you‚Äôre with me this far, you‚Äôre tentatively prepared to go along with the idea that indeed, it‚Äôs theories all the way down. Our theories are supported by facts which in turn are justified by evidence. But if the established facts support the theory, doesn‚Äôt that ‚Äúprove‚Äù it?

> **Wait.** Doesn‚Äôt that just take us back to Laws as ‚Äúproven theories‚Äù? 
>
> **Glad you asked.** That sounds like a word-game, but it‚Äôs more. Can there every be enough evidence? 

### Frogs and Squirrels: Proof

My impression of the *normal* use of ‚Äúprove" ‚Äî and yours, I‚Äôll bet‚Äîimplies something that‚Äôs final and beyond question. Its everyday usage probably comes from memories of mathematical proofs, which are iron-clad processes of reaching a conclusion through a series of **deductions** from a set of premises. Look at this figure:

syllogysm.png *If the words were not enough, a Venn diagram should make it unavoidably clear: C is all within A, so Socrates is mortal. Can‚Äôt get any more confident of the conclusion than this!*

The blue figure represents all men who are Socrates, the green circle represents all people who are men, and the red circle represents all mortals who are men. It‚Äôs logically impossible to claim that this diagram would allow any Socrates to not also be mortal.

This is the essence of one of the simplest forms of deductive reasoning called the *syllogism*. It was Aristotle‚Äôs invention and his favorite and this is his example which is as obvious today as it was for Aristotle‚Äôs students and friends. Even if it‚Äôs not written in ancient Greek! Here it is in its formal layout:

- All men are mortal.
- Socrates is a man.
- Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

The power of this is not about Socrates, but the general nature of the form of the argument. It‚Äôs mathematical in nature. Do you remember the "transitive property" of arithmetic? If $A = B$ and $B=C$ then $A=C$? This is precisely the same story about Socrates but dressed up to look like middle school math without any reference to a gadfly philosopher or the species of men. Within the tight little universe of the assertions and the conclusion, there is no room for dispute in a deductive argument: Socrates can be nothing but mortal, $A$ cannot be anything but $C$.

Since deduction is how you go from one point to the next in a proof, it‚Äôs easy to see why ‚Äúproof‚Äù carries a heavy responsibility and that‚Äôs the problem with using the word ‚Äúproof‚Äù in a scientific context.

Rene Descartes in the 17th century was the paradigm deduction champion at the beginning of modern western philosophy and tried to take that method into physics (which was called natural philosophy). Newton was at first a fan, but then changed his tune.

Do you learn anything new from a deductive proof? In going from premises to conclusion nothing entered the process that wasn‚Äôt already there to begin with, so the conclusion seems to be "inside" of the premises all along! This was so important to Plato, that he decided that one already knows mathematics and that you are actually remembering things in a deductive proof that you already knew. You‚Äôd just forgotten.

Just to be perverse, here‚Äôs another syllogism of exactly the same form as the previous one:

- All frogs are coffee pots.
- This animal is a frog.
- Therefore, this animal is a coffee pot.

This has exactly the same validity as the Socrates example‚Äîit fits the Venn diagram. But nobody would accuse a frog of being a kitchen appliance. Obviously, the viability of the premises in a deductive argument makes the whole thing sensible...or nonsense. Dare I ask, is it a fact that frogs are coffee pots? If it were so, then the syllogism is not only formally correct, but also leads to a reasonable conclusion about green amphibians.

Does science work this way? There was a time in the 17th and 18th century‚Äîthe "Scientific Revolution" time‚Äîwhen marvels were being unearthed and thousands of years-old puzzles were being explained. The successes were so impressive that it came to be appreciated that maybe this new invention of science must be taking us directly to nature‚Äôs truths. We now know that science is not that clean.

Before I moved to East Lansing I‚Äôd seen lots of squirrels in my life. They were all brown and I had created a Theory of Squirrels in my brain that said, "All squirrels are brown." Indeed, I would have said that it was a fact that squirrels are brown and that fact was justified by my many observations of squirrels, all of which were brown. That‚Äôs lots of squirrels.

Imagine my surprise in 1980 when I saw hundreds of black squirrels in my new Michigan town. My justification took a turn for the worse. My theory of squirrels was defeated. (Luckily I‚Äôd not announced a Law of Squirrels!) I later learned that the black squirrel had been intentionally brought to the Michigan State campus in the 1950s and obviously spread to town. So if I‚Äôd moved to Michigan in the 1940‚Äôs my theory of squirrels would have received continued justification.

I was reminded that reasoning by induction is risky and that facts can change.

Remember **induction**? It‚Äôs ‚Äúthe other‚Äù form of reasoning where you observe a pattern or some process over and over‚Äîmaybe under controlled (scientific?) conditions‚Äîand then abstract from those observations to a general statement of fact. The facts are a statement of what I know up until now, but my theory is a framework that permits me to predict the future. You can imagine that for the first 30 years of my life I was constantly uttering: 

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a brown squirrel. 

There‚Äôs another brown squirrel. 

There‚Äôs another brown squirrel. 

There‚Äôs another brown squirrel. 

There‚Äôs another brown squirrel.‚Äù

In my 20‚Äôs maybe: ‚ÄúIt is a fact that my observed squirrels are all brown.‚Äù

Then, triumphantly, ‚ÄúMy theory of squirrels is that all squirrels are brown.‚Äù

That‚Äôs induction. But a theory that comes from induction is subject to modification or even rejection since only a single instance can disappoint. (By the way, I‚Äôd insist that every observation of a brown squirrel was factual! I was justified in every observation that brownness was what that squirrel presented to me.

Certainly there‚Äôs a lot of induction in science. In fact Galileo‚Äôs contemporary and correspondent Francis Bacon enthusiastically built a case for science based on induction‚Äîat about the same time that Descartes did the same thing for deduction. Both have their uses today. A mathematical physicist is likely to be deducing consequences of theories and models, an experimental physicist is likely to be inductively drawing conclusions from patterns in data, while that same experimental physicist is likely to be using deduction in the process of debugging malfunctioning equipment, and an electrical engineer or scientist designing digital electronic circuits will be deeply immersed in the individual components in a circuit that explicitly uses deductive logic.

So one logical size doesn‚Äôt fit all, but it‚Äôs even more interesting. A case can be made that the process that‚Äôs closest to a recognizable science is the form of reasoning called **abduction** which is more like what a detective does, at least in fiction. One *reasons to the most likely conclusion*. You do this all the time:

>Suppose your car won‚Äôt start. There are a thousand reasons why that be the case: it could be fairies, it could be an evil spell, it could be a prank from your roommate (who‚Äôs always a pain), it could be that your battery is old and you listened to the radio last night after shutting off the engine, it could be that you‚Äôre out of gas. Because of a variety of experiences you‚Äôve had regarding mystical creatures, magic, the fact that your roommate is out of town, how batteries are rumored to work, and that you‚Äôd filled your tank the day before would cause you to *abduct* to the conclusion that your battery is probably discharged because of its age. Abduction is the most recognizable form of reasoning that scientists generally engage in. It involves expertise, it is not iron-clad (you could have a leak in your gas tank), and it‚Äôs not based on a string of observations like brown squirrels.

<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">
Was Sherlock Holmes the Master of Deduction? Nope. He was the Master of Abduction.
</p>


Can you imagine that it‚Äôs hard to be sure? Absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, sure about something that‚Äôs discovered in nature? We cannot be. The assumption about frogs and coffee pots might have come from an abductive process, and a chain of deductive logic might lead you to a conclusion that you‚Äôd like to declare is a true statement about nature. But we‚Äôd have been wrong.

We‚Äôll see below that what we test are models of nature. The consequences of a model are deductive in that the chain of reasoning leads from assumptions to what should happen in the future‚Äîa prediction. It‚Äôs those pesky assumptions that make the whole process contingent and impermanent: no absolute truth and certainly no proof. I‚Äôll leave you with this:

- Particles cannot go faster than the speed of light.
- Neutrinos are particles.
- Neutrinos cannot go faster than the speed of light.

Had we taken that first premise to be indisputable‚Äîtrue forever and ever and beyond questioning‚Äîthen we would not have taken the Opera claim seriously. But that‚Äôs not how science works and not what the community did. We worked hard to find evidence that the first premise was not a fact (that maybe it was a black squirrel). We‚Äôre now more trusting of the conclusion about the speed of light which wouldn‚Äôt have occurred without that nervous year.



# Models

## It is not possible to test a theory. We test models.

I‚Äôve discarded Laws and truth and proof and so it‚Äôs time to confront the idea of a theory and how we can trust one or not. ‚ÄúWhat is a theory,‚Äù is a valid question.

I've thought about this a lot. We have an idea of what a theory is, but do we directly test a theory? I don't think so. I think we make models following the rules and suggestions of a theory and we then **we test the model**. I'll try to explain why. Beware that this may be controversial...it's my idea that may not have occurred to others unless they've been condemned to this dual life that I have of both a scientific and philosophical education. It's a living, but it's not easy.

### Planes, Trains, and Automobiles: Models

When I was a kid, I was consumed by models of cars‚Äî ‚Äúhot rods‚Äù of the 1960s. And airplanes. And HO train sets. In short, life-like replicas of transportation tools were my passion when I wasn‚Äôt playing or watching baseball.

A plastic model stands for‚Äîrepresents‚Äîa real thing in the world, not perfectly, but well enough to complete a mission. In my case, that mission was a 13 year old boy imagining the car that he‚Äôd work on and own some day. If my plastic 1967 Chevy with baby moon wheels, GM 350 cubes with aluminum heads, Edelbrock intake manifold, Holley 4bbl, HPC Coated Headers w/Dual Exhaust, painted baby blue was made more and more precise, it would eventually become...a real car.

chevybox.png intage Revell model ‚Äô57 Chevy. In the box.

I‚Äôve been careful in what I wrote in other posts to do two things. First, I referred to scientific **statements** and **models** of nature. Gone are the days when a physicist can construct a mathematical description of say a block of wood sliding down a plane of wood and proudly proclaim that what‚Äôs written in symbols on paper is a 1:1 faithful reproduction of what happens in the laboratory.

Now we operate from a more hazy, removed vantage point. As we consider electric and magnetic fields, relativity, and quantum mechanics the correspondence between a mathematical description and what nature is supposed to be like will become necessarily more indirect and abstract.

I now tend to think of a theory as a broad **framework** within which there are many ways to address nature from within the framework. But what we don‚Äôt do is test the theory, rather we build mathematical models that use the rules (from within the framework) of a theory to address a particular, well-defined piece of nature with predictions. Then experiments are done to test the model, not the theory.

Let‚Äôs pick on Special Relativity again. I can tell you the Theory of Relativity in these three lines:

1. The rules of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.
2. The speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference. 
3. The interval between two spacetime events is Minkowskian.

The first two statements are called the Postulates of Relativity and the last statement is a consequence of the mathematization of the theory in geometry. 

This is the Theory of Relativity‚Ä¶the framework within which any scientific statement must fit. You don‚Äôt need to understand what these sentences mean, but you can surely see that they don‚Äôt contain a single mathematic equation. That‚Äôs where the models come in. 

In my way of thinking, a mathematical model of nature is a little machine that you run to a result at the end when you add some information at the beginning. The result can be, and usually is, the prediction of what an experiment would find. That result can also be another equation, distilled from input equations. 

We will use the Theory of Relativity quite a bit, but our confrontation with nature will be through models that are built within the framework of the Theory of Relativity. 

An important aspect of a model is that it must respect a possible measurement‚Äôs capabilities. A model is not meant to be a 1:1 representation of nature, just like the model car is not a real car. It‚Äôs a limited representation that can be tested. Here‚Äôs what I mean.

I can create a model for how fast a block will move across a table if it‚Äôs pushed with a given force. If that‚Äôs all I want to know, that‚Äôs a pretty easy thing to predict. But notice that it‚Äôs not the whole story of what goes on. The table and the block heat up and so energy is lost to the warming air. There are billions of little, complex atomic bonds between the under-surface of the block and the table-top. There‚Äôs a lot of physics involved in describing this event and how much detail I include in the model depends on a) *what I want to know* from my measurement and b) *how well I need to know* it. My model could include all of those thermodynamic and atomic effects but I wouldn‚Äôt include them if I can‚Äôt measure the speed very precisely. 

Physicists learn to stick to the Goldilocks Rule of Modeling. A model can‚Äôt be too crude and a model can‚Äôt be too precise‚Ä¶a model needs to be Just Right.


To summarize: 

* accept a theory and its rules; build mathematical models within the theory to represent nature (but not in a 1:1 sense); 
* make predictions from those models and test them in experiments; 
* accept or reject the model based on the results of the experiments. 

That‚Äôs the game that I‚Äôve played for four decades in which I‚Äôve never left the theory of quantum mechanics, the theory of special relativity, nor the theory of general relativity...but I‚Äôve tested lots of models.

#### Statements

It‚Äôs a detail, but an important one. We cannot test nature directly. We can only assess the truth or falsity only of statements. This reflects a remoteness of a scientist relative to nature itself. So a prediction and a test of that prediction is really testing statements and not theories and not nature. I confess this is hard to appreciate and I can probably argue even with myself about it.

### Memory Medicine: Confirmation and Disconfirmation

In my car I just heard an advertisement for a supplement that would make me remember things better. (I don‚Äôt remember its name...see what I did there?) It apparently has been ‚Äúproven‚Äù to be effective. Well, by now you know my problems with that word, but what is it that scientists can actually say about a model and indirectly, the theory framework within which it functions?

The black squirrel issue makes it clear that proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that an inductive model is true is risky and historically unproductive. 

* The word that we use when evidence supports a model‚Äôs prediction is "*confirm*"...the model‚Äôs prediction is *confirmed*, definately not ‚Äúproved.‚Äù 
* The word we use when a model‚Äôs prediction is contradicted is "disconfirmed.‚Äù
* The burden of any model is that it must be "falsifiable" or in principle be disconfirmable. 

A couple of notes. ‚ÄúConfirm‚Äù is weaker than prove, leaving us the necessary freedom to allow that evidence can change our models and even theories. Those theories that I keep saying we trust? They have been confirmed many, many times. (It‚Äôs fair to think that maybe a Law is just a really, well-confirmed theory. But I‚Äôm fighting that older picture of Newtonian-like Laws.) 

That last bullet is important and has a special place in the Philosophy of Science‚Äîand is the center of a couple of serious arguments in my fields of physics right now. 

> You might have heard some of this in the news and the falsifiability test of a theory (the word used then) is attributed to the philosopher, **Karl Popper**. He thought this was a worthy goal of science because showing something to be wrong is actually a deductive process, the inverse of showing that something agrees.

To a Popperian (my pejorative word) a single instance of disconfirmation should eliminate a model from study (they would say "theory"). A single black squirrel? That‚Äôs nice sounding, but not how science actually works and is philosophically troublesome (ask Mr Google about the Duhem‚ÄìQuine thesis)‚Äìthat black squirrel could have just been in a dust-bin. 

>The requirement of falsifiability as a standard required of science has pretty much stuck with us.

Can you see how this in-principle falsifiability requirement actually feeds my original assertion above about how to tell if a statement is scientific or not? The latter is just a simpler version of the former.

The bottom line here is this:

<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">The burden on science is not to prove things about nature, but to confirm or disconfirm statements about nature. </p>

In QS&BB, we‚Äôll watch revolutions in science that create large frameworks in which models are tested, rejected, and accepted. These frameworks I will call *theories* and I can list them for you:

1.  Newton‚Äôs laws of motion (remember?)
2.  Newton‚Äôs law of Gravitation
3.  Maxwell‚Äôs Theory of Electromagnetism
4.  Quantum Mechanics
5.  Special Relativity Theory
6.  The General Theory of Relativity

In my picture, there are not many theories in physics. 

Other topics like the big bang? quarks? nuclear physics? the standard model of particle physics? These are all models within the currently acceptable theories (frameworks) of 4, 5, and 6 above. Numbers 1 and 2? They‚Äôve been replaced!

### Laziness: Belief

One more word that both has no place in science but is one of those words we use all the time: **Belief.** We all talk about what we believe (and don‚Äôt), and scientists will sometimes colloquially do that in a scientific context, but that‚Äôs sloppy. When I say ‚ÄúI believe in X,‚Äù what I really mean is that that job that word does is act as a shorthand for the sentence: ‚ÄúX is highly confirmed by experiments and X is likely to survive foreseeable experimental tests if asked.‚Äù If I‚Äôm an expert in the field of X, then I have the obligation to describe those experimental tests. If I‚Äôm not an expert in X and I want to echo an expert‚Äôs "belief," I should expect that expert could also enumerate its experimental successes in detail on my behalf. (That‚Äôs a little tricky.)

There are dos and don‚Äôts here for scientists (and students of science). When it comes to belief in a scientific statement, I can‚Äôt do three things: 

1. I can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because I want to, 
2. I can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because my gut or a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù suggests that I should, and 
3. I can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because just because a non-expert or an authoritative text tells me to. Likewise, I can‚Äôt say that I *don‚Äôt* believe in X for any of those same three reasons
