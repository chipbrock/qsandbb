# short bio

I am an experimental elementary particle physicist and a University Distinguished Professor at Michigan State University (MSU). I earned my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Iowa State University in 1972. After a year in industry, I returned to academia, completing an M.S. in Physics and the Philosophy of Science at Northern Illinois University and a Ph.D. in Physics at Carnegie-Mellon University in 1980. Following two years as a postdoctoral researcher at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, I joined the MSU Department of Physics and Astronomy in 1982, and in 2011, I was honored as a University Distinguished Professor.

As Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy from 1994 to 2001, I oversaw the construction of a new department building, facilitated MSU’s involvement in the construction of the SOAR 4m telescope in Chile, and integrated the private Abrams Planetarium into the department. After stepping down as Chair in 2001, I returned to full-time research and teaching in particle physics.

In the 1980s, I served as spokesperson for Fermilab’s neutrino experiment E733 and have been a member of the Fermilab D0 collaboration since its early days. I’ve taken on leadership roles in significant measurements and the development of D0 apparatus components, including chairing the experiment’s Computing Policy Board and assembling an early grid Linux farm that generated 1 billion Monte Carlo events in the late 1990s.

I am also a member of MSU’s LHC ATLAS group, where I was the first convenor of the Single Top Group and led the “Phase 0” "CMX" trigger electronics upgrade for the L1Calo system. Together with a colleague from the University of Michigan, I conceived and continue to direct the ATLAS “Tier 2” data center, funded through competitive awards.

In 2010, I served as Chair of the APS Division of Particles and Fields. Over the years, I’ve been a member of the DOE High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP), the United States representative to the International Committee on Future Accelerators (ICFA), and served two terms on the Fermilab Physics Advisory Committee. I’ve also been a member of the Fermilab Research Alliance Board of Directors, the United States ATLAS Institutional Board Chair for two years, and co-convened the DPF Snowmass 2013 Energy Frontier study, which covered all aspects of particle physics.

Throughout my career, I’ve taught across the undergraduate and graduate curricula, and in recent years, I’ve focused on teaching general education students. I developed two unique courses for non-science majors: one that intertwines the history of physics with the history of art and another exploring elementary particle physics and cosmology.

I’ve authored or co-authored over 1,000 publications in experimental and phenomenological particle physics and have been continuously funded by the National Science Foundation since 1982. I’m a Fellow of the American Physical Society and have received two all-university awards from MSU for research and teaching.

Outside of physics, I’m a lifelong baseball fan and have spent many years coaching high school baseball in East Lansing.
