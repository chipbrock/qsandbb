In the 1970s there was an unpopular national speed limit of 55 mph and the catch-phrase used to encourage compliance was: ‘It’s not just a good idea, it’s the law.’ That’s one interpretation of a law—an instruction which you should obey but can choose to violate albeit with possible consequences. But you can violate that highway law without altering the universe.But then there are Laws…indisputable statements. Sometimes Epic in importance. What are scientific laws?\n\n\n\n\n\n8 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.00 knowledge\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOS\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\nℹ️ README: Many learned treatise have been written to characterize Scientific Knowledge. There’s something different about it than everyday knowledge which is easy to say…but hard to describe. I’ll try here with my take on this that’s decidedly not learned but I think I could defend it. I know when I or a colleague am behaving scientifically and that the knowledge we’ve produced is legitimately scientific, but isn’t it interesting that it’s hard to describe?\n\n\n\n\n\n5 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.00 facts and truth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOS\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\nℹ️ README: ‘Fact’ is another one of those words. You might want to say that science consists of facts arranged in order to support or define theories…or just collect data or artifacts. There’s an assumption built into that sentiment: on the one hand there are facts about the world and on the other hand, there are opinions about the world and science works hard to separate the two…and reserve ‘facts’ as the fuel for theories and guard against opinion from influencing that process.\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.00 proof\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOS\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\nℹ️ README: proof post content\n\n\n\n\n\n11 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.00 models\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOS\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\nℹ️ README: I’ve thought about this a lot. We have an idea of what a theory is, but do we directly test a theory? I don’t think so. I think we make models following the rules and suggestions of a theory and we then test the model. I’ll try to explain why. Beware that this may be controversial…it’s my idea that may not have occurred to others unless they’ve been condemned to this dual life that I have of both a scientific and philosophical education. It’s a living, but it’s not easy.\n\n\n\n\n\n9 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.00 reality\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOS\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\nℹ️ README: reality post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.00 what is a particle interaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeynman Diagrams\n\n\n\nwhat is a particle interaction post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.00 what is a feynman diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeynman Diagrams\n\n\n\nwhat is a feynman diagram post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.00 two kinds of diagrams\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeynman Diagrams\n\n\n\ntwo kinds of diagrams post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.00 some relativity ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeynman Diagrams\n\n\n\nsome relativity ideas post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.00 a primitive diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeynman Diagrams\n\n\n\na primitive diagram post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeynman Diagrams\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfeynman_diagrams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nelectron\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle Bios\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\nelectron post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalpha\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle Bios\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\nalpha post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeta\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle Bios\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\nbeta post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngamma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle Bios\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\ngamma post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquanta\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle Bios\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\nquanta post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nphoton\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle Bios\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\nphoton post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnucleus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle Bios\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\nnucleus post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1913 proton\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle Bios\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\nproton post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1920 neutron\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle Bios\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\nneutron post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.00 a primitive diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle Bios\n\n\n\na primitive diagram post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1928 positron\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle Bios\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\npositron post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1930 electron neutrino\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle Bios\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\nelectron neutrino post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1937 muon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle Bios\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\nmuon post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1804 atom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle Bios\n\n\ndraft\n\n\n\natom post content\n\n\n\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNature of Science (aka NOS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nphilosophy\n\n\nNOS\n\n\nscience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 1, 2025\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmusings\n\n\nphilosophy\n\n\nscience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 1, 2025\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle Biographies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparticles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 1, 2025\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n  \n\n Back to top"

    "text": "1 It is not possible to test a theory. We test models.\nI’ve discarded Laws and truth and proof and so it’s time to confront the idea of a theory and how we can trust one or not. “What is a theory,” is a valid question.\n\n1.1 Planes, Trains, and Automobiles: Models\nWhen I was a kid, I was consumed by models of cars— “hot rods” of the 1960s. And airplanes. And HO train sets. In short, life-like replicas of transportation tools were my passion when I wasn’t playing or watching baseball.\nA plastic model stands for—represents—a real thing in the world, not perfectly, but well enough to complete a mission. In my case, that mission was a 13 year old boy imagining the car that he’d work on and own some day. If my plastic 1967 Chevy with baby moon wheels, GM 350 cubes with aluminum heads, Edelbrock intake manifold, Holley 4bbl, HPC Coated Headers w/Dual Exhaust, painted baby blue was made more and more precise, it would eventually become…a real car.\nchevybox.png intage Revell model ’57 Chevy. In the box.\nI’ve been careful in what I wrote in other posts to do two things. First, I referred to scientific statements and models of nature. Gone are the days when a physicist can construct a mathematical description of say a block of wood sliding down a plane of wood and proudly proclaim that what’s written in symbols on paper is a 1:1 faithful reproduction of what happens in the laboratory.\nNow we operate from a more hazy, removed vantage point. As we consider electric and magnetic fields, relativity, and quantum mechanics the correspondence between a mathematical description and what nature is supposed to be like will become necessarily more indirect and abstract.\nI now tend to think of a theory as a broad framework within which there are many ways to address nature from within the framework. But what we don’t do is test the theory, rather we build mathematical models that use the rules (from within the framework) of a theory to address a particular, well-defined piece of nature with predictions. Then experiments are done to test the model, not the theory.\nLet’s pick on Special Relativity again. I can tell you the Theory of Relativity in these three lines:\n\nThe rules of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe interval between two spacetime events is Minkowskian.\n\nThe first two statements are called the Postulates of Relativity and the last statement is a consequence of the mathematization of the theory in geometry.\nThis is the Theory of Relativity…the framework within which any scientific statement must fit. You don’t need to understand what these sentences mean, but you can surely see that they don’t contain a single mathematic equation. That’s where the models come in.\nIn my way of thinking, a mathematical model of nature is a little machine that you run to a result at the end when you add some information at the beginning. The result can be, and usually is, the prediction of what an experiment would find. That result can also be another equation, distilled from input equations.\nWe will use the Theory of Relativity quite a bit, but our confrontation with nature will be through models that are built within the framework of the Theory of Relativity.\nAn important aspect of a model is that it must respect a possible measurement’s capabilities. A model is not meant to be a 1:1 representation of nature, just like the model car is not a real car. It’s a limited representation that can be tested. Here’s what I mean.\nI can create a model for how fast a block will move across a table if it’s pushed with a given force. If that’s all I want to know, that’s a pretty easy thing to predict. But notice that it’s not the whole story of what goes on. The table and the block heat up and so energy is lost to the warming air. There are billions of little, complex atomic bonds between the under-surface of the block and the table-top. There’s a lot of physics involved in describing this event and how much detail I include in the model depends on a) what I want to know from my measurement and b) how well I need to know it. My model could include all of those thermodynamic and atomic effects but I wouldn’t include them if I can’t measure the speed very precisely.\nPhysicists learn to stick to the Goldilocks Rule of Modeling. A model can’t be too crude and a model can’t be too precise…a model needs to be Just Right.\nTo summarize:\n\naccept a theory and its rules; build mathematical models within the theory to represent nature (but not in a 1:1 sense);\nmake predictions from those models and test them in experiments;\naccept or reject the model based on the results of the experiments.\n\nThat’s the game that I’ve played for four decades in which I’ve never left the theory of quantum mechanics, the theory of special relativity, nor the theory of general relativity…but I’ve tested lots of models.\n\n1.1.1 Statements\nIt’s a detail, but an important one. We cannot test nature directly. We can only assess the truth or falsity only of statements. This reflects a remoteness of a scientist relative to nature itself. So a prediction and a test of that prediction is really testing statements and not theories and not nature. I confess this is hard to appreciate and I can probably argue even with myself about it.\npainting.png In some ways, what an artist does when she paints a landscape is make a model of it. Representation theory is a serious part of “Semiotics” which is a sophisticated discipline in philosophy, linguistics, and aesthetics.\n\n\n\n1.2 Memory Medicine: Confirmation and Disconfirmation\nIn my car I just heard an advertisement for a supplement that would make me remember things better. (I don’t remember its name…see what I did there?) It apparently has been “proven” to be effective. Well, by now you know my problems with that word, but what is it that scientists can actually say about a model and indirectly, the theory framework within which it functions?\nThe black squirrel issue makes it clear that proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that an inductive model is true is risky and historically unproductive.\n\nThe word that we use when evidence supports a model’s prediction is “confirm”…the model’s prediction is confirmed, definately not “proved.”\nThe word we use when a model’s prediction is contradicted is “disconfirmed.”\nThe burden of any model is that it must be “falsifiable” or in principle be disconfirmable.\n\nA couple of notes. “Confirm” is weaker than prove, leaving us the necessary freedom to allow that evidence can change our models and even theories. Those theories that I keep saying we trust? They have been confirmed many, many times. (It’s fair to think that maybe a Law is just a really, well-confirmed theory. But I’m fighting that older picture of Newtonian-like Laws.)\nThat last bullet is important and has a special place in the Philosophy of Science—and is the center of a couple of serious arguments in my fields of physics right now.\n\nYou might have heard some of this in the news and the falsifiability test of a theory (the word used then) is attributed to the philosopher, Karl Popper. He thought this was a worthy goal of science because showing something to be wrong is actually a deductive process, the inverse of showing that something agrees.\n\nTo a Popperian (my pejorative word) a single instance of disconfirmation should eliminate a model from study (they would say “theory”). A single black squirrel? That’s nice sounding, but not how science actually works and is philosophically troublesome (ask Mr Google about the Duhem–Quine thesis)–that black squirrel could have just been in a dust-bin.\n\nThe requirement of falsifiability as a standard required of science has pretty much stuck with us.\n\nCan you see how this in-principle falsifiability requirement actually feeds my original assertion above about how to tell if a statement is scientific or not? The latter is just a simpler version of the former.\nThe bottom line here is this:\n\nThe burden on science is not to prove things about nature, but to confirm or disconfirm statements about nature.\n\nIn QS&BB, we’ll watch revolutions in science that create large frameworks in which models are tested, rejected, and accepted. These frameworks I will call theories and I can list them for you:\n\nNewton’s laws of motion (remember?)\nNewton’s law of Gravitation\nMaxwell’s Theory of Electromagnetism\nQuantum Mechanics\nSpecial Relativity Theory\nThe General Theory of Relativity\n\nIn my picture, there are not many theories in physics.\nOther topics like the big bang? quarks? nuclear physics? the standard model of particle physics? These are all models within the currently acceptable theories (frameworks) of 4, 5, and 6 above. Numbers 1 and 2? They’ve been replaced!\n\n\n1.3 Laziness: Belief\nOne more word that both has no place in science but is one of those words we use all the time: Belief. We all talk about what we believe (and don’t), and scientists will sometimes colloquially do that in a scientific context, but that’s sloppy. When I say “I believe in X,” what I really mean is that that job that word does is act as a shorthand for the sentence: “X is highly confirmed by experiments and X is likely to survive foreseeable experimental tests if asked.” If I’m an expert in the field of X, then I have the obligation to describe those experimental tests. If I’m not an expert in X and I want to echo an expert’s “belief,” I should expect that expert could also enumerate its experimental successes in detail on my behalf. (That’s a little tricky.)\nThere are dos and don’ts here for scientists (and students of science). When it comes to belief in a scientific statement, I can’t do three things:\n\nI can’t say that I believe in X because I want to,\nI can’t say that I believe in X because my gut or a “feeling” suggests that I should, and\nI can’t say that I believe in X because just because a non-expert or an authoritative text tells me to. Likewise, I can’t say that I don’t believe in X for any of those same three reasons\n\n\n\n👈 Previous: 4.00 proof | Next: 6.00 reality 👉"

    "text": "1.1 My criterion for a proper scientific statement\nThis is treading into waters that force one to determine what is and what isn’t proper the scientific process. Historically. that’s the problem of demarcating Scientific Knowledge from “Pseudoscientific Knowledge.” Here’s my rule:\nIn order for you to assert a statement about the natural world as legitimately scientific, you must be able to state what it would take to change your mind.\nNobody said, “Let’s ignore this evidence because Relativity must be true.” We all said, “Wow. This is probably a mistake but we’d better spend a year around the world checking it.”\nProponents of scientific statements can always tell you what evidence would force them to abandon one of their favorite theories, Here, a superluminal particle qualifies as one of those pieces of evidence that could in-principle have overthrown Relativity.\nProponents of unscientific statements cannot – or will not – do that. The most obvious contemporary example of unscientific assertions are those that come from creationism or “intelligent design.” Unlike Opera, proponents of these systems of belief hold that some parts of their knowledge territory are off-limits for questioning.\n“X” cannot be doubted? Then X may be some form of knowledge, but it’s not scientific knowledge.\n\nWait. Why shouldn’t students be taught both sides of such a disagreement about our origins?\nGlad you asked. That’s now called “teach the controversy“ and it’s not appropriate in a science class for two reasons. First, to put creationism in a science class goes against that crucial falsifiability requirement. So it’s not science. Second, science is not a democracy. There’s no requirement in how the universe works that it make people happy. It is what it is.\n\n\nWait. What about Newton’s Gravitational Theory! It’s used today even to determine satellite and spacecraft trajectories.  Glad you asked. A tiny bit of display math can answer that I hope\n\nHere is Newton’s Gravitational law (see what I did there?):\n\\[F = G\\frac{M_1M_2}{R_{12}}\\]\nIn words, this formula says that the force of gravitational attraction between two objects that have masses of \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\) and whose centers are separated by the distance \\(R_{12}\\) is that relationship. Let’s look at each piece:\n\n\\(G\\) is called the gravitational constant (or Newton’s constant). It’s very hard to measure and as a resut it’s the worst measured constant of nature of all. A question of scientific research today.\n\\(M\\) is the mass…which is a very complicated thing. We are at work as we speak at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland trying to understand mass. A question of scientific research today.\n\\(R^2\\) …that “2” in the formula is a direct consequence of the presumption that we have three dimensions of space. It’s a measurable quantity – and is not very precisely determined and the notion that we have three and not more spaciial dimensions is a question of scientific research today.\n\nSo every term in Newton’s Gravatation law is uncertain and theoretically of interest. Again, Laws shouldn’t do that.\n\nWait. So, what can you believe in?  Glad you asked. That’s an understandable concern for folks who don’t do science for a living. We have theories and they are all questionable. We must live in a world that is full of uncertainty and a scientific world where no idea is permanent. I suspect that’s uncomfortable for many but it’s our lives.\n\nSo “theories all the way down” really means that we have a few theories that we trust very well and we don’t question them now unless a surprise happens. And we have many theories that are not trusted as much. So not turtles all the way down, but theories of varying degrees of trustworthiness.\nIn QS&BB we’ll work with the nuts and bolts of science: theories and models and this site will consist of the stories of how theories came to be, how they were modified, how they disappeared, and how we know so much more about the universe as a result.\n\n\nNext: 2.00 knowledge 👉"

Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy\n\nWe’re about to follow two big stories which are chapters in the biggest story of all: the “just so” tale of the beginning of the universe. Yes, that one. Everything. The plot of this story has all sorts of twists and turns that we’re still unraveling. Surprises await.\nOf course, the details are where the devil lives and they are fiercely complex. So much so that two entirely different scientific communities are currently deployed to battle with nature, who likes to keep secrets: those of us who work on the “outside” and those who explore the “inside.” The outside crew are astronomers and astrophysicists. They measure and characterize the constituents and nature of the cosmos. They look out. The inside teams mimic the earliest picoseconds of the universe by recreating its incredibly hot, adolescent conditions in laboratories here on the Earth. These are the particle physicists and they look in. I’m one of those. QS&BB is the story of both."

    "text": "2 What’s the smallest thing we can know about?\n\n2.1 Inside for my grandparents.\nFor people of my grandparents’ generation, the sophisticated answer would be “what you can see.” I was born in the year 1950, and so my grandparents were children at the dawn of the 20th century which is when physics got interesting. They would have been taught that if you can’t see it, then it can’t be real. To claim otherwise would be absurd. Chemists spoke of atoms, but were disdainful of anyone who thought they were real. They were just a shorthand picture for how to visualize elements. Physicists were even less flexible.\n\n\n2.2 Inside for my parents.\nFor people of my parents’ generation, the answer would have been “protons, neutrons, and electrons.” The atom had been thrust into believability around the turn of the century, and then refined during the next two decades. But the neat planet-like picture of the atom was where it all stopped for many.\n\n\n2.3 Inside…for us!\nIn our generation, the answer to the “smallest” question has been “quarks and leptons” …but we fully expect that they are not the end of the “smallest” story. We’re hard at work, even as we speak with brand new tools to explore further than ever before.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a computer reconstruction of the collision of two protons at the Large Hadron Collider. The ATLAS experiment is one of two gargantian ‘detectors’ that catches the debris from these energetic collisions. The figure shows how two quarks in each of the colliding protons bounce off from one another and emerge in two collimated ‘jets’ of debris as they rip through the detector. The view is from the side and the lengths of these jets is each about 30 feet long. The length that the colliding quarks probed is about 0.000000000000000018 meters. This is today’s answer to the ‘how small’ question.\n\n\n\nMaybe in your generation? The sky’s the limit! We’ve hints at solving some old puzzles and we’ll undoubtedly find new ones. We’re developing and deploying amazing new instruments and theoretical ideas now rub shoulders with not just nature, but philosophy and the deepest questions asked by humans. Your generation is going to see amazing things.\nThrough decades of intense experimentation and imaginative theorizing, the tiniest bits of reality are turning out to be a fascinating collection of objects. In the 1950s and 1960s, we just stood back and tried to catch the hundreds of particles that our experiments spit out at us. New particles every year! Names that nobody could remember. Hundreds of them, which was ludicrous! Didn’t nature have some plan?\n\n“Quarks”? “Leptons”? Lots of jargon and I’ll keep it all straight for you as we go along.For now, quarks are itsy-bitsy pieces of the proton and leptons include the electron and others. New states of matter might be: “additional quarks, the Higgs Boson, Supersymmetric Particles, Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), Dark Matter particles…” all famous candidates for future discovery. Of course whenever we get too cocky, nature plots to surprise us with something completely unexpected—more often than we’d like to admit! So, we’re instinctively wary of being too sure of what’s coming.\n\nThe good news is that we’ve uncovered a model that’s a very good picture of how much of the fundamental particles of the universe work together and we’ve been exploring it since the 1970s. We’ve knitted that earlier mess together into a coherent picture of the entities themselves as well as the rules that govern how that stuff behaves. But we’re unhappy. Our grand synthesis of the Tiniest Bits Story—called the Standard Model — needs some polishing. Or more. While it’s been the gold-standard of the successful scientific theory, we expect that new tiny bits are lurking in our experiments and we will be astonished if nothing shows up as we dig deeper. This new anticipation would have been met with blank stares only a couple of decades ago.\nSo much for the inside effort."

So what’s the biggest real thing you can know about?\n\n3.1 Outside for my grandparents.\nFor people of my grandparents’ generation the learned answer to this question would be “the size of the Milky Way,” which they would have been taught constituted the whole universe. Everything visible in the night sky was thought to be a part of one big, but still cozy cluster of stars which we see to be densest around the southern sky (from North America). Not only was my grandparents’ universe compact, it was supposed to be permanent—static and unchanging— built of three kinds of objects: planets, stars, and clusters of stars. Stars twinkled, planets were steadfastly bright, and clusters of stars were fuzzy, indicative of their presumed distances from us. Sure, they all moved with regularity during each night and shifted slightly in a year, but the large scale structure of my grandparents’ universe was simple: a nice, intimate, dependable universe.\n\n\n3.2 Outside for my parents.\nFor people of my parents’ generation, the universe suddenly became huge. Those fuzzy clusters were found to be other galaxies outside of the Milky Way which are surprisingly far from us—we’re not alone in our comfy galaxy. They were taught about thousands—we now know, billions—of others, of which the Milky Way is a relatively modest and ordinary example.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, a compilation of hundreds of days of observation of a single dime-sized patch on the sky in the constellation, Fornax. Every spot is a galaxy, some nearby and some at the edge of our ability to see.\n\n\n\n\nwidth: 550px name: ultraextreme\nalign: center\n\nThis is the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, a compilation of hundreds of days of observation of a single dime-sized patch on the sky in the constellation, Fornax. Every spot is a galaxy, some nearby and some at the edge of our ability to see. ```\nIn this remarkable galactic family photograph the youngest galaxy imaged is 13.2 billion years old. We see it as it was when its light left its surface, on the way to the Hubble’s camera. It’s also a time when the universe was much smaller than it is now. This picture is today’s answer to the “biggest thing” question.\n\n\n3.3 Outside for us.\nBut, the real shocker was the overthrow of the static universe of my grandparents era. My parents’ universe was found to be flying apart—expanding—at a breakneck speed. No longer a tight-knit, stable thing…the universe is now huge and reckless. The really unsettling piece of news for my generation is that the Big Questions of antiquity are now legitimate scientific research programs: Was there a beginning to the universe? Are we alone? Will the universe end? Are there other universes? Was there anything before The Beginning? What drives the expansion of our universe to accelerate? The outside crowd thinks big thoughts now and this is a development of only the last couple of decades.\nWhen I was in graduate school, a professor told me that Cosmology was “physics knitting.” Not any more! Cosmology in my and especially your generation is going to be flat-out amazing!\n\nAn Auspicious Beginning\n\nYes. The observable universe had a beginning, and quite a beginning it must have been: it was a roiling mess of radiation and elementary particles at temperatures never to be seen again. Everything that is—space, time, and all of energy—would have been confined into a size smaller than a baseball. Unthinkably dense and with growth that was stunningly rapid, our early universe defies imagination. It’s so outrageous that comprehending it seems a job for fiction and not science, yet my generation has also found ways to explore it: we probe it through direct telescope observations and we remake it in particle collisions. This is the blending of the outside with the inside pictures that motivates me.\n\nWait. I don’t believe in the big bang. You appear to, but isn’t what you think just another “belief”? Aren’t we each entitled to our own beliefs?  Glad you asked. “Belief” is a tricky word that we all use, although in our context, we should be clear and I’ll try to do that in the next lesson."

In this course, I offer a broad overview of these fields tailored for general education students—students who, by the way, help fund our work through their taxes. The focus is on storytelling, using simple math as a tool to support the narrative of history and the lives of the scientists behind the discoveries."

    "text": "1 Theories cannot be proven.\n“Just the facts, Ma’am.” An iconic catch-phrase uttered by Detective Joe Friday on the 1950’s crime show, Dragnet. Everyone knows what a fact is, right? Well it’s a fact that Joe Friday never said that line in the TV program, but ask anyone over the age of 60 and chances are that they will agree that it’s a fact that Detective Friday uttered that line in every episode. But he didn’t. That’s an urban myth born of a popular 1953 spoof of the program, Little Blue Riding Hood. Google it and listen (it’s only 3 minutes).\n“Fact” is another one of those words. You might want to say that science consists of facts arranged in order to support or define theories…or just collect data or artifacts. There’s an assumption built into that sentiment: on the one hand there are facts about the world and on the other hand, there are opinions about the world and science works hard to separate the two…and reserve “facts” as the fuel for theories and guard against opinion from influencing that process. That’s the case. But like Law, this burden given to “fact” sometimes assigns to it the responsibility of being a “true thing.” But even in everyday life, let alone in nearly every crime novel ever written, facts depend on evidence and evidence is a set of informed observations. And observations change, they evolve, or they can be mistaken.\nA plausible-sounding, if simplified cartoon of the scientific method might be: evidence \\(\\to\\) facts \\(\\to\\) Laws. But if Laws are not forever, where in this chain does uncertainty sneak in? Obviously, it’s that evidence and facts are not permanent. It was a fact that the evidence pointed to the fact that all objects move slower than the speed of light, but when the evidence appeared to change we were prepared to dispute the theory and so Relativity as a Law in the Florida-sense didn’t fit.\nMore appropriate is a chain that goes like: evidence \\(\\to\\) facts \\(\\to\\) theories. And then depending on the accumulation of the evidence that justify the facts, we have theories we trust a lot and theories we’re just beginning to get to know. But since evidence is contingent, facts are contingent, and so theories are contingent. Any or all can change and it takes a professional scientist to know when to pull the plug on any one of them."

    "text": "2 It is not possible to prove a theory.\nOkay, if you’re with me this far, you’re tentatively prepared to go along with the idea that indeed, it’s theories all the way down. Our theories are supported by facts which in turn are justified by evidence. But if the established facts support the theory, doesn’t that “prove” it?\n\nWait. Doesn’t that just take us back to Laws as “proven theories”?\nGlad you asked. That sounds like a word-game, but it’s more. Can there every be enough evidence?\n\n\n2.1 Frogs and Squirrels: Proof\nMy impression of the normal use of “prove” — and yours, I’ll bet—implies something that’s final and beyond question. Its everyday usage probably comes from memories of mathematical proofs, which are iron-clad processes of reaching a conclusion through a series of deductions from a set of premises. Look at this figure:\nsyllogysm.png If the words were not enough, a Venn diagram should make it unavoidably clear: C is all within A, so Socrates is mortal. Can’t get any more confident of the conclusion than this!\nThe blue figure represents all men who are Socrates, the green circle represents all people who are men, and the red circle represents all mortals who are men. It’s logically impossible to claim that this diagram would allow any Socrates to not also be mortal.\nThis is the essence of one of the simplest forms of deductive reasoning called the syllogism. It was Aristotle’s invention and his favorite and this is his example which is as obvious today as it was for Aristotle’s students and friends. Even if it’s not written in ancient Greek! Here it is in its formal layout:\n\nAll men are mortal.\nSocrates is a man.\nTherefore, Socrates is mortal.\n\nThe power of this is not about Socrates, but the general nature of the form of the argument. It’s mathematical in nature. Do you remember the “transitive property” of arithmetic? If \\(A = B\\) and \\(B=C\\) then \\(A=C\\)? This is precisely the same story about Socrates but dressed up to look like middle school math without any reference to a gadfly philosopher or the species of men. Within the tight little universe of the assertions and the conclusion, there is no room for dispute in a deductive argument: Socrates can be nothing but mortal, \\(A\\) cannot be anything but \\(C\\).\nSince deduction is how you go from one point to the next in a proof, it’s easy to see why “proof” carries a heavy responsibility and that’s the problem with using the word “proof” in a scientific context.\nRene Descartes in the 17th century was the paradigm deduction champion at the beginning of modern western philosophy and tried to take that method into physics (which was called natural philosophy). Newton was at first a fan, but then changed his tune.\nDo you learn anything new from a deductive proof? In going from premises to conclusion nothing entered the process that wasn’t already there to begin with, so the conclusion seems to be “inside” of the premises all along! This was so important to Plato, that he decided that one already knows mathematics and that you are actually remembering things in a deductive proof that you already knew. You’d just forgotten.\nJust to be perverse, here’s another syllogism of exactly the same form as the previous one:\n\nAll frogs are coffee pots.\nThis animal is a frog.\nTherefore, this animal is a coffee pot.\n\nThis has exactly the same validity as the Socrates example—it fits the Venn diagram. But nobody would accuse a frog of being a kitchen appliance. Obviously, the viability of the premises in a deductive argument makes the whole thing sensible…or nonsense. Dare I ask, is it a fact that frogs are coffee pots? If it were so, then the syllogism is not only formally correct, but also leads to a reasonable conclusion about green amphibians.\nDoes science work this way? There was a time in the 17th and 18th century—the “Scientific Revolution” time—when marvels were being unearthed and thousands of years-old puzzles were being explained. The successes were so impressive that it came to be appreciated that maybe this new invention of science must be taking us directly to nature’s truths. We now know that science is not that clean.\nBefore I moved to East Lansing I’d seen lots of squirrels in my life. They were all brown and I had created a Theory of Squirrels in my brain that said, “All squirrels are brown.” Indeed, I would have said that it was a fact that squirrels are brown and that fact was justified by my many observations of squirrels, all of which were brown. That’s lots of squirrels.\nImagine my surprise in 1980 when I saw hundreds of black squirrels in my new Michigan town. My justification took a turn for the worse. My theory of squirrels was defeated. (Luckily I’d not announced a Law of Squirrels!) I later learned that the black squirrel had been intentionally brought to the Michigan State campus in the 1950s and obviously spread to town. So if I’d moved to Michigan in the 1940’s my theory of squirrels would have received continued justification.\nI was reminded that reasoning by induction is risky and that facts can change.\nRemember induction? It’s “the other” form of reasoning where you observe a pattern or some process over and over—maybe under controlled (scientific?) conditions—and then abstract from those observations to a general statement of fact. The facts are a statement of what I know up until now, but my theory is a framework that permits me to predict the future. You can imagine that for the first 30 years of my life I was constantly uttering:\n“There’s a brown squirrel.\nThere’s another brown squirrel.\nThere’s another brown squirrel.\nThere’s another brown squirrel.\nThere’s another brown squirrel.”\nIn my 20’s maybe: “It is a fact that my observed squirrels are all brown.”\nThen, triumphantly, “My theory of squirrels is that all squirrels are brown.”\nThat’s induction. But a theory that comes from induction is subject to modification or even rejection since only a single instance can disappoint. (By the way, I’d insist that every observation of a brown squirrel was factual! I was justified in every observation that brownness was what that squirrel presented to me.\nCertainly there’s a lot of induction in science. In fact Galileo’s contemporary and correspondent Francis Bacon enthusiastically built a case for science based on induction—at about the same time that Descartes did the same thing for deduction. Both have their uses today. A mathematical physicist is likely to be deducing consequences of theories and models, an experimental physicist is likely to be inductively drawing conclusions from patterns in data, while that same experimental physicist is likely to be using deduction in the process of debugging malfunctioning equipment, and an electrical engineer or scientist designing digital electronic circuits will be deeply immersed in the individual components in a circuit that explicitly uses deductive logic.\nSo one logical size doesn’t fit all, but it’s even more interesting. A case can be made that the process that’s closest to a recognizable science is the form of reasoning called abduction which is more like what a detective does, at least in fiction. One reasons to the most likely conclusion. You do this all the time:\n\nSuppose your car won’t start. There are a thousand reasons why that be the case: it could be fairies, it could be an evil spell, it could be a prank from your roommate (who’s always a pain), it could be that your battery is old and you listened to the radio last night after shutting off the engine, it could be that you’re out of gas. Because of a variety of experiences you’ve had regarding mystical creatures, magic, the fact that your roommate is out of town, how batteries are rumored to work, and that you’d filled your tank the day before would cause you to abduct to the conclusion that your battery is probably discharged because of its age. Abduction is the most recognizable form of reasoning that scientists generally engage in. It involves expertise, it is not iron-clad (you could have a leak in your gas tank), and it’s not based on a string of observations like brown squirrels.\n\n\nWas Sherlock Holmes the Master of Deduction? Nope. He was the Master of Abduction.\n\nCan you imagine that it’s hard to be sure? Absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, sure about something that’s discovered in nature? We cannot be. The assumption about frogs and coffee pots might have come from an abductive process, and a chain of deductive logic might lead you to a conclusion that you’d like to declare is a true statement about nature. But we’d have been wrong.\nWe’ll see below that what we test are models of nature. The consequences of a model are deductive in that the chain of reasoning leads from assumptions to what should happen in the future—a prediction. It’s those pesky assumptions that make the whole process contingent and impermanent: no absolute truth and certainly no proof. I’ll leave you with this:\n\nParticles cannot go faster than the speed of light.\nNeutrinos are particles.\nNeutrinos cannot go faster than the speed of light.\n\nHad we taken that first premise to be indisputable—true forever and ever and beyond questioning—then we would not have taken the Opera claim seriously. But that’s not how science works and not what the community did. We worked hard to find evidence that the first premise was not a fact (that maybe it was a black squirrel). We’re now more trusting of the conclusion about the speed of light which wouldn’t have occurred without that nervous year.\n\n\n👈 Previous: 3.00 truth | Next: 5.00 models 👉"

Theories, laws, facts, proof, truth are all related verses in a compliated song and while we scientists know what we mean…it’s confusing. You see, we’ve got two problems: we use language and we’re human. Scientists converse in everyday terms. Like normal people. But while we use normal words in real life, some of them are different in scientific life.\nAs for crying? Years ago I was triggered by a long argument in the state of Florida.\nAround 2008 the Florida State Board of Education was grappling with their grade of “F” in a national review of science education. And, of course instructions to teachers on how to teach evolution was a major issue. A few states insisted on teaching creationism, or the cloak-and-dagger idea of “Intelligent Design,” along side of, or in place of actual science.\nSo after many, many hearings, reports, testimony from Nobel laureats, and very public disputes, The fuss was resolved by mandating that whenever evolution was mentioned, it was to be referred to as the Theory of Evolution. By contrast, whenever Newton’s rule regarding gravity was used, it was to be called Newton’s Law of Gravitation. Law, good. Theory? Notsomuch. Remembering this story is why I have on my unhappy face right now.[^law]\nSo I have rules (for myself) and in physics classes that I teach that can be summed up as:"

    "text": "2 It is not possible to test a theory. We test models.\nI’ve discarded Laws and truth and proof and so it’s time to confront the idea of a theory and how we can trust one or not. “What is a theory,” is a valid question.\n\n2.1 Planes, Trains, and Automobiles: Models\nWhen I was a kid, I was consumed by models of cars— “hot rods” of the 1960s. And airplanes. And HO train sets. In short, life-like replicas of transportation tools were my passion when I wasn’t playing or watching baseball.\nA plastic model stands for—represents—a real thing in the world, not perfectly, but well enough to complete a mission. In my case, that mission was a 13 year old boy imagining the car that he’d work on and own some day. If my plastic 1967 Chevy with baby moon wheels, GM 350 cubes with aluminum heads, Edelbrock intake manifold, Holley 4bbl, HPC Coated Headers w/Dual Exhaust, painted baby blue was made more and more precise, it would eventually become…a real car.\nchevybox.png intage Revell model ’57 Chevy. In the box.\nI’ve been careful in what I wrote above to do two things. First, I referred to scientific statements and models of nature. Gone are the days when a physicist can construct a mathematical description of say a block of wood sliding down a plane of wood and proudly proclaim that what’s written in symbols on paper is a 1:1 faithful reproduction of what happens in the laboratory.\nNow we operate from a more hazy, removed vantage point. As we get into electric and magnetic fields, relativity, and quantum mechanics the correspondence between a mathematical description and what nature is supposed to be like will become necessarily more indirect and abstract.\nI now tend to think of a theory as a broad framework within which there are many ways to address nature from within the framework. But what we don’t do is test the theory, rather we build mathematical models that use the rules (from within the framework) of a theory to address a particular, well-defined piece of nature with predictions. Then experiments are done to test the model, not the theory.\nLet’s pick on Special Relativity again. I can tell you the Theory of Relativity in these three lines:\n\nThe rules of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe interval between two spacetime events is Minkowskian.\n\nThe first two statements are called the Postulates of Relativity and the last statement is a consequence of the mathematization of the theory in geometry.\nThis is the Theory of Relativity…the framework within which any scientific statement must fit. You don’t need to understand what these sentences mean, but you can surely see that they don’t contain a single mathematic equation. That’s where the models come in.\nIn my way of thinking, a mathematical model of nature is a little machine that you a result at the end when you add some information at the beginning. The result can be, and usually is, the prediction of what an experiment would find. That result can also be another equation, distilled from input equations.\nWe will use the Theory of Relativity above quite a bit, but our confrontation with nature will be through models that are built within the framework of the Theory of Relativity.\nAn important aspect of a model is that it must respect a possible measurement’s capabilities. A model is not meant to be a 1:1 representation of nature, just like the model car is not a real car. It’s a limited representation that can be tested. Here’s what I mean.\nI can create a model for how fast a block will move across a table if it’s pushed with a given force. If that’s all I want to know, that’s a pretty easy thing to predict. But notice that it’s not the whole story of what goes on. The table and the block heat up and so energy is lost to the warming air. There are billions of little, complex atomic bonds between the under-surface of the block and the table-top. There’s a lot of physics involved in describing this event and how much detail I include in the model depends on a) what I want to know from my measurement and b) how well I need to know it. My model could include all of those thermodynamic and atomic effects but I wouldn’t include them if I can’t measure the speed very precisely.\nPhysicists learn to stick to the Goldilocks Rule of Modeling. A model can’t be too crude and a model can’t be too precise…a model needs to be Just Right.\nTo summarize:\n\naccept a theory and its rules; build mathematical models within the theory to represent nature (but not in a 1:1 sense);\nmake predictions from those models and test them in experiments;\naccept or reject the model based on the results of the experiments.\n\nThat’s the game that I’ve played for four decades in which I’ve never left the theory of quantum mechanics, the theory of special relativity, nor the theory of general relativity…but I’ve tested lots of models.\n\n2.1.1 Statements\nIt’s a detail, but an important one. We cannot test nature directly. We can only assess the truth or falsity only of statements. This reflects a remoteness of a scientist relative to nature itself. So a prediction and a test of that prediction is really testing statements and not theories and not nature. I confess this is hard to appreciate and I can probably argue even with myself about it.\npainting.png In some ways, what an artist does when she paints a landscape is make a model of it. Representation theory is a serious part of “Semiotics” which is a sophisticated discipline in philosophy, linguistics, and aesthetics.\n\n\n\n2.2 Memory Medicine: Confirmation and Disconfirmation\nIn my car I just heard an advertisement for a supplement that would make me remember things better. (I don’t remember its name…see what I did there?) It apparently has been “proven” to be effective. Well, by now you know my problems with that word, but what is it that scientists can actually say about a model and indirectly, the theory framework within which it functions?\nThe black squirrel issue makes it clear that proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that an inductive model is true is risky and historically unproductive.\n\nThe word that we use when evidence supports a model’s prediction is “confirm”…the model’s prediction is confirmed, definately not “proved.”\nThe word we use when a model’s prediction is contradicted is “disconfirmed.”\nThe burden of any model is that it must be “falsifiable” or in principle be disconfirmable.\n\nA couple of notes. “Confirm” is weaker than prove, leaving us the necessary freedom to allow that evidence can change our models and even theories. Those theories that I keep saying we trust? They have been confirmed many, many times. (It’s fair to think that maybe a Law is just a really, well-confirmed theory. But I’m fighting that older picture of Newtonian-like Laws.)\nThat last bullet is important and has a special place in the Philosophy of Science—and is the center of a couple of serious arguments in my fields of physics right now.\n\nYou might have heard some of this in the news and the falsifiability test of a theory (the word used then) is attributed to the philosopher, Karl Popper. He thought this was a worthy goal of science because showing something to be wrong is actually a deductive process, the inverse of showing that something agrees.\n\nTo a Popperian (my pejorative word) a single instance of disconfirmation should eliminate a model from study (they would say “theory”). A single black squirrel? That’s nice sounding, but not how science actually works and is philosophically troublesome (ask Mr Google about the Duhem–Quine thesis)–that black squirrel could have just been in a dust-bin.\n\nThe requirement of falsifiability as a standard required of science has pretty much stuck with us.\n\nCan you see how this in-principle falsifiability requirement actually feeds my original assertion above about how to tell if a statement is scientific or not? The latter is just a simpler version of the former.\nThe bottom line here is this:\n\nThe burden on science is not to prove things about nature, but to confirm or disconfirm statements about nature.\n\nIn QS&BB, we’ll watch revolutions in science that create large frameworks in which models are tested, rejected, and accepted. These frameworks I will call theories and I can list them for you:\n\nNewton’s laws of motion (remember?)\nNewton’s law of Gravitation\nMaxwell’s Theory of Electromagnetism\nQuantum Mechanics\nSpecial Relativity Theory\nThe General Theory of Relativity\n\nIn my picture, there are not many theories in physics.\nOther topics like the big bang? quarks? nuclear physics? the standard model of particle physics? These are all models within the currently acceptable theories (frameworks) of 4, 5, and 6 above. Numbers 1 and 2? They’ve been replaced!\n\n\n2.3 Laziness: Belief\nOne more word that both has no place in science but is one of those words we use all the time: Belief. We all talk about what we believe (and don’t), and scientists will sometimes colloquially do that in a scientific context, but that’s sloppy. When I say “I believe in X,” what I really mean is that that job that word does is act as a shorthand for the sentence: “X is highly confirmed by experiments and X is likely to survive foreseeable experimental tests if asked.” If I’m an expert in the field of X, then I have the obligation to describe those experimental tests. If I’m not an expert in X and I want to echo an expert’s “belief,” I should expect that expert could also enumerate its experimental successes in detail on my behalf. (That’s a little tricky.)\nThere are dos and don’ts here for scientists (and students of science). When it comes to belief in a scientific statement, I can’t do three things:\n\nI can’t say that I believe in X because I want to,\nI can’t say that I believe in X because my gut or a “feeling” suggests that I should, and\nI can’t say that I believe in X because just because a non-expert or an authoritative text tells me to. Likewise, I can’t say that I don’t believe in X for any of those same three reasons."

The Nobel physicist from the University of Texas, Stephen Weinberg is both a prolific scientist, but also a writer of non-specialist books, the most famous being The First Three Minutes. One of his later books for the public is Dreams of a Final Theory and his last chapter is called Against Philosophy where he notes, “I know how philosophers feel about attempts by scientists at amateur philosophy. But I do not aim here to play the role of a philosopher, but rather that of a specimen, an unregenerate working scientist who finds no help in professional philosophy. I am not alone in this; I know of no one who has participated actively in the advance of physics in the postwar period whose research has been significantly helped by the work of philosophers.”\nOne of the more disturbing ways in which philosophy of science has drifted is in the denial of the project of science as learning about the physical world. Rather, science is deemed to be a social activity without the ability"

    "text": "5 Scientific knowledge is a unique kind of knowledge.\nWhat you’ll see is that in a very subtle and surprising way, science is contingent. Evidence can lead to the overthrow if previously trusted theories. Facts can lose their permanence, proof is impossible except in mathematics, and models are meant to be tested, revised, and tested again.\nDoesn’t this go against the common notion that science is the final arbiter of truth? It’s complicated and when this contingency meets a unique pandemic and scientists are building the airplane while they’re flying it, in public, misunderstanding can be the result."

    "section": "1 The biggest stories of all",
    "text": "1 The biggest stories of all\n\nIn the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy\n\nWe’re about to follow two big stories which are chapters in the biggest story of all: the “just so” tale of the beginning of the universe. Yes, that one. Everything. The plot of this story has all sorts of twists and turns that we’re still unraveling. Surprises await.\nOf course, the details are where the devil lives and they are fiercely complex. So much so that two entirely different scientific communities are currently deployed to battle with nature, who likes to keep secrets: those of us who work on the “outside” and those who explore the “inside.” The outside crew are astronomers and astrophysicists. They measure and characterize the constituents and nature of the cosmos. They look out. The inside teams mimic the earliest picoseconds of the universe by recreating its incredibly hot, adolescent conditions in laboratories here on the Earth. These are the particle physicists and they look in. I’m one of those. QS&BB is the story of both.\n\nWhat’s the smallest thing we can know about?\n\n\n1.1 Inside for my grandparents.\nFor people of my grandparents’ generation, the sophisticated answer would be “what you can see.” I was born in the year 1950, and so my grandparents were children at the dawn of the 20th century which is when physics got interesting. They would have been taught that if you can’t see it, then it can’t be real. To claim otherwise would be absurd. Chemists spoke of atoms, but were disdainful of anyone who thought they were real. They were just a shorthand picture for how to visualize elements. Physicists were even less flexible.\n\n\n1.2 Inside for my parents.\nFor people of my parents’ generation, the answer would have been “protons, neutrons, and electrons.” The atom had been thrust into believability around the turn of the century, and then refined during the next two decades. But the neat planet-like picture of the atom was where it all stopped for many.\n\n\n1.3 Inside…for us!\nIn our generation, the answer to the “smallest” question has been “quarks and leptons” …but we fully expect that they are not the end of the “smallest” story. We’re hard at work, even as we speak with brand new tools to explore further than ever before.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a computer reconstruction of the collision of two protons at the Large Hadron Collider. The ATLAS experiment is one of two gargantian ‘detectors’ that catches the debris from these energetic collisions. The figure shows how two quarks in each of the colliding protons bounce off from one another and emerge in two collimated ‘jets’ of debris as they rip through the detector. The view is from the side and the lengths of these jets is each about 30 feet long. The length that the colliding quarks probed is about 0.000000000000000018 meters. This is today’s answer to the ‘how small’ question.\n\n\n\nMaybe in your generation? The sky’s the limit! We’ve hints at solving some old puzzles and we’ll undoubtedly find new ones. We’re developing and deploying amazing new instruments and theoretical ideas now rub shoulders with not just nature, but philosophy and the deepest questions asked by humans. Your generation is going to see amazing things.\nThrough decades of intense experimentation and imaginative theorizing, the tiniest bits of reality are turning out to be a fascinating collection of objects. In the 1950s and 1960s, we just stood back and tried to catch the hundreds of particles that our experiments spit out at us. New particles every year! Names that nobody could remember. Hundreds of them, which was ludicrous! Didn’t nature have some plan?\n\n“Quarks”? “Leptons”? Lots of jargon and I’ll keep it all straight for you as we go along.For now, quarks are itsy-bitsy pieces of the proton and leptons include the electron and others. New states of matter might be: “additional quarks, the Higgs Boson, Supersymmetric Particles, Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), Dark Matter particles…” all famous candidates for future discovery. Of course whenever we get too cocky, nature plots to surprise us with something completely unexpected—more often than we’d like to admit! So, we’re instinctively wary of being too sure of what’s coming.\n\nThe good news is that we’ve uncovered a model that’s a very good picture of how much of the fundamental particles of the universe work together and we’ve been exploring it since the 1970s. We’ve knitted that earlier mess together into a coherent picture of the entities themselves as well as the rules that govern how that stuff behaves. But we’re unhappy. Our grand synthesis of the Tiniest Bits Story—called the Standard Model — needs some polishing. Or more. While it’s been the gold-standard of the successful scientific theory, we expect that new tiny bits are lurking in our experiments and we will be astonished if nothing shows up as we dig deeper. This new anticipation would have been met with blank stares only a couple of decades ago.\nSo much for the inside effort.\n\nOkay. So what’s the biggest real thing you can know about?\n\n\n\n1.4 Outside for my grandparents.\nFor people of my grandparents’ generation the learned answer to this question would be “the size of the Milky Way,” which they would have been taught constituted the whole universe. Everything visible in the night sky was thought to be a part of one big, but still cozy cluster of stars which we see to be densest around the southern sky (from North America). Not only was my grandparents’ universe compact, it was supposed to be permanent—static and unchanging— built of three kinds of objects: planets, stars, and clusters of stars. Stars twinkled, planets were steadfastly bright, and clusters of stars were fuzzy, indicative of their presumed distances from us. Sure, they all moved with regularity during each night and shifted slightly in a year, but the large scale structure of my grandparents’ universe was simple: a nice, intimate, dependable universe.\n\n\n1.5 Outside for my parents.\nFor people of my parents’ generation, the universe suddenly became huge. Those fuzzy clusters were found to be other galaxies outside of the Milky Way which are surprisingly far from us—we’re not alone in our comfy galaxy. They were taught about thousands—we now know, billions—of others, of which the Milky Way is a relatively modest and ordinary example.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, a compilation of hundreds of days of observation of a single dime-sized patch on the sky in the constellation, Fornax. Every spot is a galaxy, some nearby and some at the edge of our ability to see.\n\n\n\nThis is the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, a compilation of hundreds of days of observation of a single dime-sized patch on the sky in the constellation, Fornax. Every spot is a galaxy, some nearby and some at the edge of our ability to see. ```\nIn this remarkable galactic family photograph the youngest galaxy imaged is 13.2 billion years old. We see it as it was when its light left its surface, on the way to the Hubble’s camera. It’s also a time when the universe was much smaller than it is now. This picture is today’s answer to the “biggest thing” question.\n\n\n1.6 Outside for us.\nBut, the real shocker was the overthrow of the static universe of my grandparents era. My parents’ universe was found to be flying apart—expanding—at a breakneck speed. No longer a tight-knit, stable thing…the universe is now huge and reckless. The really unsettling piece of news for my generation is that the Big Questions of antiquity are now legitimate scientific research programs: Was there a beginning to the universe? Are we alone? Will the universe end? Are there other universes? Was there anything before The Beginning? What drives the expansion of our universe to accelerate? The outside crowd thinks big thoughts now and this is a development of only the last couple of decades.\nWhen I was in graduate school, a professor told me that Cosmology was “physics knitting.” Not any more! Cosmology in my and especially your generation is going to be flat-out amazing!\n\nAn Auspicious Beginning\n\nYes. The observable universe had a beginning, and quite a beginning it must have been: it was a roiling mess of radiation and elementary particles at temperatures never to be seen again. Everything that is—space, time, and all of energy—would have been confined into a size smaller than a baseball. Unthinkably dense and with growth that was stunningly rapid, our early universe defies imagination. It’s so outrageous that comprehending it seems a job for fiction and not science, yet my generation has also found ways to explore it: we probe it through direct telescope observations and we remake it in particle collisions. This is the blending of the outside with the inside pictures that motivates me.\n\nWait. I don’t believe in the big bang. You appear to, but isn’t what you think just another “belief”? Aren’t we each entitled to our own beliefs?  Glad you asked. “Belief” is a tricky word that we all use, although in our context, we should be clear and I’ll try to do that in the next lesson."

I work on one (big!) experiment but there are many dozens of experiments involving thousands of us all around the globe — and in orbit above the globe and in deep underground laboratories inside of the globe — to push ourselves to the story’s climax."

I earned my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Iowa State University in 1972. After a year in industry, I returned to academia, completing an M.S. in Physics and the Philosophy of Science at Northern Illinois University and a Ph.D. in Physics at Carnegie-Mellon University in 1980. Following two years as a postdoctoral researcher at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, I joined the MSU Department of Physics and Astronomy in 1982, and in 2011, I was honored as a University Distinguished Professor.\nAs Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy from 1994 to 2001, I oversaw the construction of a new department building, facilitated MSU’s involvement in the construction of the SOAR 4m telescope in Chile, and integrated the private Abrams Planetarium into the department. After stepping down as Chair in 2001, I returned to full-time research and teaching in particle physics.\nIn the 1980s, I served as spokesperson for Fermilab’s neutrino experiment E733 and have been a member of the Fermilab D0 collaboration since its early days. I’ve taken on leadership roles in significant measurements and the development of D0 apparatus components, including chairing the experiment’s Computing Policy Board and assembling an early grid Linux farm that generated 1 billion Monte Carlo events in the late 1990s.\nI am also a member of MSU’s LHC ATLAS group, where I was the first convenor of the Single Top Group and led the “Phase 0” “CMX” trigger electronics upgrade for the L1Calo system. Together with a colleague from the University of Michigan, I conceived and continue to direct the ATLAS “Tier 2” data center, funded through competitive awards.\nIn 2010, I served as Chair of the APS Division of Particles and Fields. Over the years, I’ve been a member of the DOE High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP), the United States representative to the International Committee on Future Accelerators (ICFA), and served two terms on the Fermilab Physics Advisory Committee. I’ve also been a member of the Fermilab Research Alliance Board of Directors, the United States ATLAS Institutional Board Chair for two years, and co-convened the DPF Snowmass 2013 Energy Frontier study, which covered all aspects of particle physics.\nThroughout my career, I’ve taught across the undergraduate and graduate curricula, and in recent years, I’ve focused on teaching general education students. I developed two unique courses for non-science majors: one that intertwines the history of physics with the history of art and another exploring elementary particle physics and cosmology.\nI’ve authored or co-authored over 1,000 publications in experimental and phenomenological particle physics and have been continuously funded by the National Science Foundation since 1982. I’m a Fellow of the American Physical Society and have received two all-university awards from MSU for research and teaching.\nOutside of physics, I’m a lifelong baseball fan and have spent many years coaching high school baseball in East Lansing.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

These days, I also serve as an Adjunct Professor of Physics at Arizona State University.\nMy bachelor’s degree is in Electrical Engineering from Iowa State University, but I switched gears after working in private industry for a short while. I went on to earn an MS in Physics and Philosophy of Science from Northern Illinois University and then completed my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University, focusing on both theoretical and experimental elementary particle physics. I spent a couple of years as a postdoctoral researcher at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and joined the MSU faculty in 1982.\nLike many scientists, I owe my inspiration to a great high school science teacher. For me, that was Walter Hauswald at Sycamore, Illinois High School. He let me help with class prep and encouraged me to explore topics like quantum mechanics outside of class. I was lucky to have him for all three years of my high school physical science courses: I dedicated my Ph.D. thesis to him.\nMy family is important to me. Janet and I have been married for more than 50 years and immensely enjoy our two grown kids and grandtwins.\n\nBTW. All my life I’ve been “Chip,” although my driver’s license and passport say “Raymond.” Before you ask, nobody claims to know where this started.
