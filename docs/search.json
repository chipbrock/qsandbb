    "text": "I’m an experimental particle physicist at Michigan State University, and I’ve benefited from the U.S. public’s support for my research over the past 50 years. Teaching these topics—especially to non-science students—has been one way to give back, and now I’m bringing these ideas to a broader audience beyond the lecture hall.\nBTW, it’s confusing having two names.\nAll my life I’ve been “Chip,” although my driver’s license says “Raymond.” Before you ask, nobody claims to know where this started. Please note before being really proud of yourself: “Chip off the old Brock” is not new, it’s not funny anymore, and all of you think you were the first to invent it…"

I earned my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Iowa State University in 1972. After a year in industry, I returned to academia, completing an M.S. in Physics and the Philosophy of Science at Northern Illinois University and a Ph.D. in Physics at Carnegie-Mellon University in 1980. Following two years as a postdoctoral researcher at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, I joined the MSU Department of Physics and Astronomy in 1982, and in 2011, I was honored as a University Distinguished Professor.\nAs Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy from 1994 to 2001, I oversaw the construction of a new department building, facilitated MSU’s involvement in the construction of the SOAR 4m telescope in Chile, and integrated the private Abrams Planetarium into the department. After stepping down as Chair in 2001, I returned to full-time research and teaching in particle physics.\nIn the 1980s, I served as spokesperson for Fermilab’s neutrino experiment E733 and have been a member of the Fermilab D0 collaboration since its early days. I’ve taken on leadership roles in significant measurements and the development of D0 apparatus components, including chairing the experiment’s Computing Policy Board and assembling an early grid Linux farm that generated 1 billion Monte Carlo events in the late 1990s.\nI am also a member of MSU’s LHC ATLAS group, where I was the first convenor of the Single Top Group and led the “Phase 0” “CMX” trigger electronics upgrade for the L1Calo system. Together with a colleague from the University of Michigan, I conceived and continue to direct the ATLAS “Tier 2” data center, funded through competitive awards.\nIn 2010, I served as Chair of the APS Division of Particles and Fields. Over the years, I’ve been a member of the DOE High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP), the United States representative to the International Committee on Future Accelerators (ICFA), and served two terms on the Fermilab Physics Advisory Committee. I’ve also been a member of the Fermilab Research Alliance Board of Directors, the United States ATLAS Institutional Board Chair for two years, and co-convened the DPF Snowmass 2013 Energy Frontier study, which covered all aspects of particle physics.\nThroughout my career, I’ve taught across the undergraduate and graduate curricula, and in recent years, I’ve focused on teaching general education students. I developed two unique courses for non-science majors: one that intertwines the history of physics with the history of art and another exploring elementary particle physics and cosmology.\nI’ve authored or co-authored over 1,000 publications in experimental and phenomenological particle physics and have been continuously funded by the National Science Foundation since 1982. I’m a Fellow of the American Physical Society and have received two all-university awards from MSU for research and teaching.\nOutside of physics, I’m a lifelong baseball fan and have spent many years coaching high school baseball in East Lansing."

These days, I also serve as an Adjunct Professor of Physics at Arizona State University.\nMy bachelor’s degree is in Electrical Engineering from Iowa State University, but I switched gears after working in private industry for a short while. I went on to earn an MS in Physics and Philosophy of Science from Northern Illinois University and then completed my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University, focusing on both theoretical and experimental elementary particle physics.\nLike many scientists, I owe my inspiration to a great high school science teacher. For me, that was Walter Hauswald at Sycamore High School. He let me help with class prep and encouraged me to explore topics like quantum mechanics outside of class. I was lucky to have him for all three years of my high school physical science courses, and I even dedicated my Ph.D. thesis to him.\nMy family is important to me. My wife and I have been married for more than 50 years and have two grown children, Kimberly and Terry who is married to Ashleigh who gave us our grandtwins, Emma and Hannah."
