How these and other tutorials differ from the ‚Äúregular‚Äù posts is that they‚Äôre organized start to finish in a logically sequential format like you expect from a (tiny) textbook.

    "text": "I‚Äôm a ‚ÄúUniversity Distinguished Professor‚Äù in the Physics and Astronomy Department at MSU, and on the MSU faculty since 1982. These days, I also serve as an Adjunct Professor of Physics at Arizona State University.\nMy bachelor‚Äôs degree is in Electrical Engineering from Iowa State University, but I switched gears after working in private industry for a short while. I went on to earn an MS in Physics and Philosophy of Science from Northern Illinois University and then completed my Ph.D.¬†at Carnegie Mellon University, focusing on both theoretical and experimental elementary particle physics. I spent a couple of years as a postdoctoral researcher at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and joined the MSU faculty in 1982.\nLike many scientists, I owe my inspiration to a great high school science teacher. For me, that was Walter Hauswald at Sycamore, Illinois High School. He let me help with class prep and encouraged me to explore topics like quantum mechanics outside of class. I was lucky to have him for all three years of my high school physical science courses: I dedicated my Ph.D.¬†thesis to him.\nMy family is important to me. Janet and I have been married for more than 50 years and immensely enjoy our two grown kids and grandtwins.\n\nBTW. All my life I‚Äôve been ‚ÄúChip,‚Äù although my driver‚Äôs license and passport say ‚ÄúRaymond.‚Äù Before you ask, nobody claims to know where this started.

    "text": "2 Simplest collision\nThere are only a few kinds of collisions. And, while I‚Äôll maintain this general term, better is ‚Äúinteraction.‚Äù The context will be clear. I hope. üôÑ\n\n2.1 Scattering interactions\nThink billiard balls. \\[\n\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B}\\to \\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B}\n\\]\nSome object (A) collides with some other object (B) and they go on their way. From your experience, you know that whatever motions A and B had before, those motions are now differently shared after. The only way that A and B are totally unscathed or affected is if they didn‚Äôt actually ‚Äúinteract‚Äù‚Ä¶like they were in separate rooms or states or planets, or they went through one another like ghosts. Not very good ‚Äúcollisions‚Äù in those silly examples.\n‚ÄúBefore‚Äù and ‚ÄúAfter‚Äù in collision-land have specific names:\n\nThe initial state of a system is the before.\nThe final state of a system is the after.\n\nThere‚Äôs more. At the point of contact something happens. Dig in to that point where the action is‚Ä¶what do you visualize? Surfaces touching surfaces? If you hear the collision, then those surfaces are vibrating when they ‚Äúclick‚Äù‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll talk about this sort of thing in some future post. But the point is that the before and after include a ‚Äúsomething happens‚Äù in the middle, where the physics happens. Usually, we want to know what goes on in that middle state.\nA and B could be the same sort of object (like two billiard balls), they could be different objects (like a golf ball and a basketball). The rules don‚Äôt change, but the final states would be different.\n\n\n2.2 Decay interactions\nHere‚Äôs another kind, where ‚Äúcollision‚Äù might not be the best term, but the rules are the same. \\[\n\\mathbf{C}\\to \\mathbf{A}+ \\mathbf{B} \\label{decay}\n\\] Here our initial state consists of one thing and the final state consists of two different things. The easiest reaction (that‚Äôs a good, inclusive term) to visualize is a firecracker, C, that explodes into two fragments, B and C. Where you had a thing now you‚Äôve got two things.\nWhile that everyday example makes sense, for our purposes, this signifies something quantum mechanical in which case the process is an interaction, but more specifically a decay. For example in particle physics there are many examples of an unstable particle that decays into two other particles. We‚Äôll create examples using the [Feynman Diagram techniques])https://chipbrock.github.io/FeynmanDiagramsEveryone/). For example, a Higgs boson can decay into two electrons. So-called Pi meson can decay into an electron and a neutrino. It goes on.\nWhile I‚Äôm on to quantum mechanics processes, there‚Äôs another kind of scattering that‚Äôs a little odd.\n\n\n2.3 Production interactions\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B}\\to \\mathbf{C}+\\mathbf{D} \\label{production}\n\\]\nThink about this. You throw a baseball, A, at a bat, B, and the result of that collision is a beagle and a refrigerator. Same rules apply here as to the previous interactions as to how the dog and the fridge move after the collision, but here and in the decay that ‚Äúin between‚Äù state is where the real action is: the how sports equipment becomes a pet and a home appliance.\nSo to the motion rules:"

    "text": "3 Conservation of momentum\nImpulse is the key. This idea comes from Isaac Newton, Christiaan Huygens, and Rene Descartes. Let‚Äôs give them all a hand: üëè . And after many years of applause, I‚Äôll bet you‚Äôre pretty good at it.\nA conserved quantity in physics is one that is unchanged during a time interval ‚Äì typically a ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù some event. These statements are called ‚ÄúConservationLaws.‚Äù There are many but the Conservation of Momentum is king of that hill.\nLet‚Äôs manage that clap so that our identical hands have the same speeds, but oppositely-directed. So their velocities are equal and opposite. That means that their momenta are related. Here‚Äôs a picture:\n\n\nCode\n# #| out.width: ‚Äú700px‚Äù  \n# #| column: screen\n#| echo: false\nknitr::include_graphics(\"clap.png\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: The before and after of a round of applause. Each hand has the same mass. Each hand approaches the other with the same velocity, but of course with opposite signs.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere‚Äôs the momentum for either one:\n\\[p(\\text{hand}) = m(\\text{hand})\\times v(\\text{hand})\\].\nThey stopped dead‚Ä¶right in front of you. What happed to the momentum of the hands? Stopping dead is just a colorful way to say that they both lost their velocities and so they both lost their momenta.\nLook at this example in order to see how we construct an important argument based on this lauditory expression of appreciation for our Dutchman. It‚Äôs based on an analysis of the impluse and out of it falls‚Ä¶Newton‚Äôs third law.\nHere‚Äôs a way of organizing this. The total momentum of a system ‚Äì¬†is just the total of all of the momenta in that system. So our initial state‚Äôs momentum is: \\[\n\\begin{align*}p(\\text{total}) &=p(\\text{left}) + p(\\text{right}) \\\\                &= p - p \\\\                &= 0\\end{align*}\n\\] Do it. You‚Äôll see that the result is that neither your right nor your left hand ‚Äúwin‚Äù‚Ä¶they stop in the middle, ‚Äúdead‚Äù‚Ä¶which is our way of saying that the total momentum of that initial state is zero.\nThe understanding of this comes from a careful analysis of the situation and what impulse really means.

It‚Äôs how you think about things normally. As time progresses, our ball doesn‚Äôt move on the table, so the x and y coordinates of the ball at any time are the same.\n\n\n5.2 spacetime diagram, stationary\nNow supposed I plot the ball‚Äôs trajectory (yes, ‚Äútrajectory‚Äù) as a function of space and time.\n\n\n\nscreenshot_3658\n\n\nNow you see ‚Äúmovement‚Äù‚Ä¶the stationary ball is moving in time. This picture is an example of a spacetime diagram. Not very interesting.\n\n\n5.3 spacespace diagram, moving!\nJust sitting still isn‚Äôt interesting, so let‚Äôs roll the ball across the pool table:\n\n\n\nscreenshot_3665\n\n\nWhile the ball moves in space, it‚Äôs also moving in time but the time coordinate is implied or hidden. The clocks show what it might be if one were to use a stopwatch to monitor its motion for 4 points along the trajectory.\nSince the ball moves only horizontally, \\(y_0\\) doesn‚Äôt change and so I can represent the motion in a space (\\(x\\)) and time (\\(t\\)) way and here is the spacetime diagram for this simple situation\nNotice that the trajectory in spacetime is a straight line and its slope? The velocity, which is a continuous curve in this diagram, and the dashed line shows it.\nThis is a model of motion, which for physicists is always a curve in some coordinate system. Here the slope is \\[\n\\begin{align}\nv &=\\dfrac{x-x_0}{t-t_0} \\nonumber \\\\\nv &= \\dfrac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\] We can easily imagine that the motion might not be smooth (like the stopping and starting on the road above) and so the concept of the average is always in play:\n\n\n\nscreenshot_3667\n\n\nThe more precisely we sample the motion, the more precisely we converge on an instantaneous speed, which you‚Äôre familiar with while driving with a speedometer in front of you. You think it‚Äôs telling you exaclty what your speed is, but it is actually digitally sampling the rotation of your tires, but very finely.\nIn physics:\n\n‚Äúkinematics‚Äù is the subject of motion\n‚Äúdynamics‚Äù is the subject of forces‚Ä¶which cause the motion\n\nGalileo introduced the idea of kinematics‚Ä¶he characterized motion without regard to what made the motion happen. Isaac Newton did the first legitimate analysis ‚Äì model¬†‚Äì of dynamics. He explained how to characterize forces and the motions that result. That‚Äôs the subject of the next chapter.\n\n\n5.4 Acceleration\nThe rolling ball‚Äôs motion in spacetime had the same slope between any two time intervals ‚Äì a straight line. So the velocity never changes.\nBut of course for motion to get started one has begin from rest and get going, so the velocity has to increase in time. That‚Äôs what acceleration is.\n\nVelocity is the rate at which distance changes in time.\nAcceleration is the rate at which velocity changes in time.\n\nHere are the two models of motion: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nv &=\\dfrac{x-x_0}{t-t_0} \\text{  model of velocity} \\\\\nv &= \\dfrac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} \\nonumber \\\\\n& \\text{ and } \\nonumber \\\\\na &=\\dfrac{v-v_0}{t-t_0}  \\text{  model of acceleration} \\nonumber \\\\\na &= \\dfrac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t} \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nSo if the speed is uniform, like the ball above, then the acceleration is zero (since \\(\\Delta v = 0\\)).\nIf the speed changes in time, then we have accelerated motion since \\(\\Delta v \\ne 0\\).\n\nDimensions of acceleration are a little unfamiliar but we can work them out:\n\n\n\nscreenshot_3668\n\n\nOf course the simplest acceleration is a constant one‚Ä¶that during any time interval, the speed increases and the rate at which the speed increases is constant. \nBut sometimes you put on the brakes, and you know that you slow down because you can feel it and the speedometer is telling you that. So in increasing time intervals, the rate at which the speed changes is negative. \nIn the diagram, \\(\\Delta v &lt; 0\\). This is a negative acceleration and is called decceleration.\nI‚Äôve concentrated on acceleration and deceleration which are constant‚Ä¶the speed changes at a uniform rate, up or down. But that‚Äôs not the only kind. Think about a sprinter. Just after the starting gun, a runner‚Äôs speed out of the blocks is high and remains high for the first few steps. As the runner starts to become a little more vertical, air resistance becomes a factor and while the runner goes faster, she does so at a lower rate of speed increase. That‚Äôs a non-constant acceleration.\n\n\n\n\n\nA sprinter‚Äôs changing acceleration. Notice that the slope changes as time inncreases\n\n\nNow you can design a sports video game. All you have to do is measure an athlete‚Äôs personal acceleration parameters and code them. I found this years ago for Madden NFL11 of a particular running back:"

How he determined this was clever and you can read the story at Galileo. What he found was that the speed of a falling object would increase linearly with the time of it‚Äôs fall. A competing idea from other natural philosophers including Leonardo DaVinci, proposed that the speed would increase linearly with distance, not time.\nWhat Galileo knew from medieval considerations was that this linearity with time for \\(v\\) meant that distance had to increase quadratically with time.\nSo, a model of Galileo‚Äôs qualitative conclusion is: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nv(t) &\\propto t \\nonumber \\\\\nx(t) &\\propto t^2 \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\] The symbol \\(\\propto\\) means ‚Äúproportional to‚Äù and when we find a relationship like that, we can turn it into an equation by inserting some constant of proportionality. For falling bodies near the earth, the symbol for that constant is called ‚Äú\\(g\\)‚Äù or ‚Äúlittle g.‚Äù Now we can fully-form the model as: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nv(t) &= gt \\nonumber \\\\\nx(t) &= 1/2gt^2 \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\] There are simplicity reasons for the 1/2‚Ä¶if we‚Äôd absorbed that into \\(g\\) then the first equation would have had to change.

In general, then, we‚Äôd use the symbol \\(a\\) and treat falling as a special case of constantly accelerated motion in which case \\(a=g\\).\nWhile we defined speed in terms of distance, we can rewrite ?@eq-eq1 \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{For constant speed,}&\\text{ no acceleration} \\\\\nv &=\\dfrac{x-x_0}{t-t_0} \\nonumber \\\\\nx-x_0 &=v(t-t_0) \\nonumber \\text{ let's take our initial time be 0} \\\\\nx &= x_0 + vt\n\\end{align}\n\\] And for constant acceleration, we can find a general relationship for distance as well with a simple calculation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è A bit of algebra is required to derive the complete quartet of equations for motion with a constant acceleration.

He called it ‚Äúimpeto‚Äù and we call it ‚Äúmomentum.‚Äù The ball acquires momentum.\nAnd he realized that whatever impeto the ball acquires in the horizontal direction is preserved, but the moment the ball leaves your hand, it starts to head toward the Earth.

But I‚Äôve already been adamant about the lack of ‚ÄúLaws‚Äù in science so a proof is obviously not my favorite idea.\nThat‚Äôs a principled stand but there‚Äôs a more practical side that argues against proof. What about a fact? It seems reasonable to imagine that I can make a measurement and establish a fact, even prove a fact. A fact can be an existence-thing and it can be a number.\nLet me take the second first. Here‚Äôs a fact: the mass of an electron is \\(9.109 \\times 10^{31}\\) kg. I measure that and so will you. It‚Äôs in books. It‚Äôs in Wikipedia!\nBut this will sound silly, but it‚Äôs maybe one of the most important and most misunderstood things about a scientific fact. If you go an measure the mass of an electron, you might get \\(9.1093837139 \\times 10^{31}\\) kg. Those aren‚Äôt the same number. You might correctly point out that they‚Äôre close and that the second one is maybe more precise and you‚Äôd be right. But what then is the proof of the fact that the electron has a particular mass? My fact is then not your fact and we can‚Äôt prove personal facts and still be scientific.\nBut there‚Äôs more. If I were to measure the mass of the electron and report it as ‚Äú\\(9.1093837139 \\times 10^{31}\\)‚Äù I‚Äôd lose my physicist union card. All‚Ä¶every single one‚Ä¶measurement of a physical ‚Äúfact‚Äù is not just a number. It‚Äôs a number plus a declaration of how well I know that number‚Ä¶the ‚Äúuncertainty.‚Äù Thankfully now when political polls are announced, the ‚Äúmargin of error‚Äù is reported. So if one candidate‚Äôs poll number is 49% and the other is 51% with a margin of error of 4%‚Ä¶they are tied. Nobody can be reported to be ahead.\nThe same thing is true in a scientific ‚Äúfact‚Äù but besides the uncertainty inherent to the number of measurements (statistical uncertainty), there are uncertainties inherent to the measurement device used. If I have a ruler marked off in only whole inches, and I measure something to be 2.5 inches long, then there‚Äôs an inherent uncertainty in that measurement that‚Äôs a significant fraction of an inch.\nSo. Facts about the natural world cannot be proven in the same sense that a mathematical proof can be proven. So when being precise in our language, scientists do not speak of having proven a fact.\n9.1093837139(28)√ó10‚àí31¬†kg[1]"

That is, science is public and how we communicate is through scientific statements. So really when one is evaluating the believability of a scientific idea‚Ä¶what you‚Äôre really evaluating is a set of statements about that idea. In everyday life, I might toss off a thought casually, without preparation or much analysis. You know, like in a normal conversation. But a scientific statement isn‚Äôt like that. It‚Äôs considered, it‚Äôs carefully put together, it‚Äôs thoughtful and meaningful. A scientific statement can be a sentence, or a whole book. The point is that a scientific statement has structure and is composed according to professional expectations."

    "text": "7 It is not possible to test a theory. We test models.\nI‚Äôve discarded Laws and truth and proof and so it‚Äôs time to confront the idea of a theory and how we can trust one or not. ‚ÄúWhat is a theory,‚Äù is a valid question.\n\n7.1 Planes, Trains, and Automobiles: Models\nWhen I was a kid, I was consumed by models of cars‚Äî ‚Äúhot rods‚Äù of the 1960s. And airplanes. And HO train sets. In short, life-like replicas of transportation tools were my passion when I wasn‚Äôt playing or watching baseball.\nA plastic model stands for‚Äîrepresents‚Äîa real thing in the world, not perfectly, but well enough to complete a mission. In my case, that mission was a 13 year old boy imagining the car that he‚Äôd work on and own some day. If my plastic 1967 Chevy with baby moon wheels, GM 350 cubes with aluminum heads, Edelbrock intake manifold, Holley 4bbl, HPC Coated Headers w/Dual Exhaust, painted baby blue was made more and more precise, it would eventually become‚Ä¶a real car.\nchevybox.png intage Revell model ‚Äô57 Chevy. In the box.\nI‚Äôve been careful in what I wrote above to do two things. First, I referred to scientific statements and models of nature. Gone are the days when a physicist can construct a mathematical description of say a block of wood sliding down a plane of wood and proudly proclaim that what‚Äôs written in symbols on paper is a 1:1 faithful reproduction of what happens in the laboratory.\nNow we operate from a more hazy, removed vantage point. As we get into electric and magnetic fields, relativity, and quantum mechanics the correspondence between a mathematical description and what nature is supposed to be like will become necessarily more indirect and abstract.\nI now tend to think of a theory as a broad framework within which there are many ways to address nature from within the framework. But what we don‚Äôt do is test the theory, rather we build mathematical models that use the rules (from within the framework) of a theory to address a particular, well-defined piece of nature with predictions. Then experiments are done to test the model, not the theory.\nLet‚Äôs pick on Special Relativity again. I can tell you the Theory of Relativity in these three lines:\n\nThe rules of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe interval between two spacetime events is Minkowskian.\n\nThe first two statements are called the Postulates of Relativity and the last statement is a consequence of the mathematization of the theory in geometry.\nThis is the Theory of Relativity‚Ä¶the framework within which any scientific statement must fit. You don‚Äôt need to understand what these sentences mean, but you can surely see that they don‚Äôt contain a single mathematic equation. That‚Äôs where the models come in.\nIn my way of thinking, a mathematical model of nature is a little machine that you a result at the end when you add some information at the beginning. The result can be, and usually is, the prediction of what an experiment would find. That result can also be another equation, distilled from input equations.\nWe will use the Theory of Relativity above quite a bit, but our confrontation with nature will be through models that are built within the framework of the Theory of Relativity.\nAn important aspect of a model is that it must respect a possible measurement‚Äôs capabilities. A model is not meant to be a 1:1 representation of nature, just like the model car is not a real car. It‚Äôs a limited representation that can be tested. Here‚Äôs what I mean.\nI can create a model for how fast a block will move across a table if it‚Äôs pushed with a given force. If that‚Äôs all I want to know, that‚Äôs a pretty easy thing to predict. But notice that it‚Äôs not the whole story of what goes on. The table and the block heat up and so energy is lost to the warming air. There are billions of little, complex atomic bonds between the under-surface of the block and the table-top. There‚Äôs a lot of physics involved in describing this event and how much detail I include in the model depends on a) what I want to know from my measurement and b) how well I need to know it. My model could include all of those thermodynamic and atomic effects but I wouldn‚Äôt include them if I can‚Äôt measure the speed very precisely.\nPhysicists learn to stick to the Goldilocks Rule of Modeling. A model can‚Äôt be too crude and a model can‚Äôt be too precise‚Ä¶a model needs to be Just Right.\nTo summarize:\n\naccept a theory and its rules; build mathematical models within the theory to represent nature (but not in a 1:1 sense);\nmake predictions from those models and test them in experiments;\naccept or reject the model based on the results of the experiments.\n\nThat‚Äôs the game that I‚Äôve played for four decades in which I‚Äôve never left the theory of quantum mechanics, the theory of special relativity, nor the theory of general relativity‚Ä¶but I‚Äôve tested lots of models.\n\n7.1.1 Statements\nIt‚Äôs a detail, but an important one. We cannot test nature directly. We can only assess the truth or falsity only of statements. This reflects a remoteness of a scientist relative to nature itself. So a prediction and a test of that prediction is really testing statements and not theories and not nature. I confess this is hard to appreciate and I can probably argue even with myself about it.\npainting.png In some ways, what an artist does when she paints a landscape is make a model of it. Representation theory is a serious part of ‚ÄúSemiotics‚Äù which is a sophisticated discipline in philosophy, linguistics, and aesthetics.\n\n\n\n7.2 Memory Medicine: Confirmation and Disconfirmation\nIn my car I just heard an advertisement for a supplement that would make me remember things better. (I don‚Äôt remember its name‚Ä¶see what I did there?) It apparently has been ‚Äúproven‚Äù to be effective. Well, by now you know my problems with that word, but what is it that scientists can actually say about a model and indirectly, the theory framework within which it functions?\nThe black squirrel issue makes it clear that proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that an inductive model is true is risky and historically unproductive.\n\nThe word that we use when evidence supports a model‚Äôs prediction is ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù‚Ä¶the model‚Äôs prediction is confirmed, definately not ‚Äúproved.‚Äù\nThe word we use when a model‚Äôs prediction is contradicted is ‚Äúdisconfirmed.‚Äù\nThe burden of any model is that it must be ‚Äúfalsifiable‚Äù or in principle be disconfirmable.\n\nA couple of notes. ‚ÄúConfirm‚Äù is weaker than prove, leaving us the necessary freedom to allow that evidence can change our models and even theories. Those theories that I keep saying we trust? They have been confirmed many, many times. (It‚Äôs fair to think that maybe a Law is just a really, well-confirmed theory. But I‚Äôm fighting that older picture of Newtonian-like Laws.)\nThat last bullet is important and has a special place in the Philosophy of Science‚Äîand is the center of a couple of serious arguments in my fields of physics right now.\n\nYou might have heard some of this in the news and the falsifiability test of a theory (the word used then) is attributed to the philosopher, Karl Popper. He thought this was a worthy goal of science because showing something to be wrong is actually a deductive process, the inverse of showing that something agrees.\n\nTo a Popperian (my pejorative word) a single instance of disconfirmation should eliminate a model from study (they would say ‚Äútheory‚Äù). A single black squirrel? That‚Äôs nice sounding, but not how science actually works and is philosophically troublesome (ask Mr Google about the Duhem‚ÄìQuine thesis)‚Äìthat black squirrel could have just been in a dust-bin.\n\nThe requirement of falsifiability as a standard required of science has pretty much stuck with us.\n\nCan you see how this in-principle falsifiability requirement actually feeds my original assertion above about how to tell if a statement is scientific or not? The latter is just a simpler version of the former.\nThe bottom line here is this:\n\nThe burden on science is not to prove things about nature, but to confirm or disconfirm statements about nature.\n\nIn QS&BB, we‚Äôll watch revolutions in science that create large frameworks in which models are tested, rejected, and accepted. These frameworks I will call theories and I can list them for you:\n\nNewton‚Äôs laws of motion (remember?)\nNewton‚Äôs law of Gravitation\nMaxwell‚Äôs Theory of Electromagnetism\nQuantum Mechanics\nSpecial Relativity Theory\nThe General Theory of Relativity\n\nIn my picture, there are not many theories in physics.\nOther topics like the big bang? quarks? nuclear physics? the standard model of particle physics? These are all models within the currently acceptable theories (frameworks) of 4, 5, and 6 above. Numbers 1 and 2? They‚Äôve been replaced!\n\n\n7.3 Laziness: Belief\nOne more word that both has no place in science but is one of those words we use all the time: Belief. We all talk about what we believe (and don‚Äôt), and scientists will sometimes colloquially do that in a scientific context, but that‚Äôs sloppy. When I say ‚ÄúI believe in X,‚Äù what I really mean is that that job that word does is act as a shorthand for the sentence: ‚ÄúX is highly confirmed by experiments and X is likely to survive foreseeable experimental tests if asked.‚Äù If I‚Äôm an expert in the field of X, then I have the obligation to describe those experimental tests. If I‚Äôm not an expert in X and I want to echo an expert‚Äôs ‚Äúbelief,‚Äù I should expect that expert could also enumerate its experimental successes in detail on my behalf. (That‚Äôs a little tricky.)\nThere are dos and don‚Äôts here for scientists (and students of science). When it comes to belief in a scientific statement, I can‚Äôt do three things:\n\nI can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because I want to,\nI can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because my gut or a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù suggests that I should, and\nI can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because just because a non-expert or an authoritative text tells me to. Likewise, I can‚Äôt say that I don‚Äôt believe in X for any of those same three reasons."

The Nobel physicist from the University of Texas, Stephen Weinberg is both a prolific scientist, but also a writer of non-specialist books, the most famous being The First Three Minutes. One of his later books for the public is Dreams of a Final Theory and his last chapter is called Against Philosophy where he notes, ‚ÄúI know how philosophers feel about attempts by scientists at amateur philosophy. But I do not aim here to play the role of a philosopher, but rather that of a specimen, an unregenerate working scientist who finds no help in professional philosophy. I am not alone in this; I know of no one who has participated actively in the advance of physics in the postwar period whose research has been significantly helped by the work of philosophers.‚Äù\nOne of the more disturbing ways in which philosophy of science has drifted is in the denial of the project of science as learning about the physical world.

You‚Äôll see all manner of ‚ÄúLaws‚Äù that follow Newton‚Äôs three Laws of Motion and Newton‚Äôs Gravitational Law: Snell‚Äôs Law, The First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics, the Law of Reflection, Faraday‚Äôs Law, Ampere‚Äôs Law‚Ä¶and so on, up to the 20th century when we got serious.\nFrom that point, it‚Äôs Einstein‚Äôs Special Theory of Relativity, Einstein‚Äôs General Theory of Relativity, Quantum Theory, Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau Theory, Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Theory, Relativistic Quantum Field Theory, Inflation Theory, the Big Bang Theory, and so on. Are we just dumber than when all of science was uncovering Laws? No.¬†Rather, around the turn of the 20th century the subtlety of science is was sinking in. But apparently not in Florida. onlytheory\nLet me tell you a story.\nThe speed of light\nWe‚Äôll spend a lot of effort becoming comfortable with Einstein‚Äôs Theory of Relativity. One of its famous, bedrock rules is that the speed of light is the fastest that anything can travel. (BTW, that‚Äôs technically a ‚Äúpostulate,‚Äù not a law.) Relativity has been confirmed so many times that we use it as a tool and not a theory to be tested‚Ä¶Florida should call it the Law of Relativity. But we don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the Theory of Relativity.\n\nThere is an elementary particle called the neutrino that is so light that it travels at almost the speed of light. In 2011 an experiment called Opera in a mountain in northern Italy was under way to measure properties of neutrinos coming from the CERN particle accelerator in Geneva, Switzerland, almost 1000 km away.\nIn order to be sure of the source of interactions, Opera had a sophisticated GPS system that measured times in Geneva and times in the mountain at a precision better than ¬±0.000000010 seconds (¬±10 nanoseconds). What they found was that the neutrinos appeared to arrive faster than the speed of light would allow, apparently violating the Theory of Relativity!\nIf Relativity were a Law of Nature in the Florida-way, say the ‚ÄúLaw of Relativity‚Äù‚Äîthen the surprising Opera measurement would have confronted the authority of the Law of Relativity and the scientists would back down: can‚Äôt cross that threshold of Law. But Opera scientists couldn‚Äôt do that. The experimenters worked very hard to redo their analyses and scoured their experimental apparatus for any place that the few nanoseconds might have been missing.\nI was a member of the Physics Advisory Committee at the Fermi National Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois which was running a similar experiment, shooting neutrinos from Illinois to a mine in northern Minnesota. We asked them and learned that they too saw an effect, but they used a conventional GPS and they couldn‚Äôt measure times precisely enough to test Opera‚Ä¶ so we bought them a fancy ‚Äì expensive ‚Äì GPS system so they could check! Meanwhile many alternative explanations around Relativity were proposed to account for the measurement. Many, many. A small theoretical physics industry of alternative ideas.\nAfter a year or so, Opera discovered a subtle, tiny, but flawed optical fiber seating that accounted for the missing few nanoseconds and then were able to conclude that Einstein could rest easy. Meanwhile, Fermilab had a shiny, new GPS system.\n\nYou get the important part of this story? Relativity is among the most trusted theories in all of science ‚Äî if anything could be labeled as ‚ÄúLaw‚Äù then this is it! And yet, when faced with an apparent problem, we had to dig deeper.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nüìù The authority of Relativity is not absolute, it‚Äôs not Law-like, but a highly trusted theory.\n\n\nI was proud of my community during that episode. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to work. There are no Laws of the capital L kind."

    "text": "1.2 My criterion for a proper scientific statement\nI‚Äôm treading into waters that force us to think about what is and what isn‚Äôt a proper scientific process. Historically. that‚Äôs the problem of demarcating Scientific Knowledge from ‚Äúpseudo-science‚Äù statements. You may have heard that scientific statements must be ‚Äúfalsifiable,‚Äù an idea often credited to the philosopher of science (and other things), Karl Popper3\nHere‚Äôs my personal rule:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nü´µ In order for you to assert a statement about the natural world as legitimately scientific, you must be able to say what it would take to change your mind.\n\n\n\nNobody said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs ignore this evidence because Relativity must be true.‚Äù We all said, ‚ÄúWow. A faster-than-light neutrino signal is probably a mistake but we‚Äôd better spend a year around the world checking it.‚Äù\n\nüëç Proponents of scientific statements can always tell you what evidence would force them to abandon one of their favorite theories, here, a superluminal particle qualifies as one of those pieces of evidence that could in-principle have overthrown Relativity.\nüëé Proponents of unscientific statements cannot ‚Äì or will not ‚Äì do that. The most obvious contemporary example of unscientific assertions are those that come from creationism or ‚Äúintelligent design.‚Äù Unlike the Opera experience, proponents of these systems of belief hold that some parts of their knowledge live in territory that is off-limits for questioning.\n\nWait. Why shouldn‚Äôt students be taught both sides of such a disagreement about our origins?\nGlad you asked. That‚Äôs now called ‚Äúteach the controversy‚Äú and it‚Äôs not appropriate in a science class for two reasons. First, to put creationism in a science class goes against that crucial falsifiability requirement. So it‚Äôs not science. Second, science is not a democracy. There‚Äôs no requirement in how the universe works that it make people happy. It is what it is.\n\nIf you believe that ‚ÄúX‚Äù cannot be doubted? Then X may be some form of knowledge, but it‚Äôs not scientific knowledge.\n\nWait. What about Newtonian Gravitation! It‚Äôs used today even to determine satellite and spacecraft trajectories.  Glad you asked. A tiny bit of display math can answer that I hope\n\nHere is Newton‚Äôs Gravitational law (see what I did there? law not Law):\n\\[F = G\\frac{M_1M_2}{R_{12}}\\]\nIn words, this formula says that the force of gravitational attraction between two objects that have masses of \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\) and whose centers are separated by the distance \\(R_{12}\\) is that relationship. Let‚Äôs look at each piece:\n\n\\(G\\) is called the gravitational constant (or Newton‚Äôs constant). It‚Äôs very hard to measure and as a resut it‚Äôs the worst measured constant of nature of all. A question of scientific research today.\n\\(M\\) is the mass‚Ä¶which is a very complicated concept. As we speake, we are at work at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland trying to understand mass. A question of scientific research today.\n\\(R^2\\) ‚Ä¶that ‚Äú2‚Äù in the formula is a direct consequence of the presumption that we have three dimensions of space. It‚Äôs a measurable quantity ‚Äì and is not very precisely determined and the notion that we have three and not more spacial dimensions is a question of scientific research today.\n\nSo every term in Newton‚Äôs Gravatation law is uncertain and theoretically of interest. Again, Laws shouldn‚Äôt do that.\n\nWait. So, what can you believe in?  Glad you asked. That‚Äôs an understandable concern for folks who don‚Äôt do science for a living. We have theories and they are all questionable. We must live in a world that is full of uncertainty and a scientific world where no idea is permanent. I suspect that‚Äôs uncomfortable for many but it‚Äôs our lives.\n\nSo ‚Äútheories all the way down‚Äù really means that we have a few theories that we trust very well and we don‚Äôt question them now unless a surprise happens. And we have many theories that are not trusted as much. So not turtles all the way down, but theories of varying degrees of trustworthiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nüìù In QS&BB we‚Äôll work with the nuts and bolts of science: theories and models and this site will consist of the stories of how theories came to be, how they were modified, how they disappeared, and how we know so much more about the universe as a result.\n\n\n\n\nNext: 2.00 models üëâ"

If I go there and don‚Äôt find my keys then either I was wrong, or someone moved my keys. While frustrated, I recognize that I can be wrong about my personal knowledge and I have personal strategies to figure out how to find a lost item. My strategies are mine. Yours are yours. A standard acceptable kind of knowledge of key-finding isn‚Äôt necessary.\nBut scientific knowledge is a little different. First of all, scientists need to agree on facts and theories. I wouldn‚Äôt tell you that your way of finding your lost keys is the wrong way, but scientists disagree all the time about whether a path to a conclusion is properly scientific. There is a loose community-acceptable kind of scientific knowledge.\nOne thing about scientific knowledge is that it‚Äôs expressed in a language made up of words, images, and mathematics. Statements in this language are constructed to represent phenomena in the physical world. There‚Äôs the world out there and there‚Äôs our incomplete knowledge of the features of that world, so we represent it according to our needs and our capabilities. Take baseball.\nI can represent a baseball game many ways, from a minimal representation of the outcome to a maximal detailed description of every pitch, the wind velocity, the groundscrew‚Äôs cutting of the grass, to the amount of Turface Quick Dry‚Ñ¢ used on the mound, to how the field was raked, and the precise height of the outfield walls. If all you need is a quick result, then the final score, runs, hits, and errors is the minimal represention of the game. Want more detail? Then the line score of runs scored every inning is a representation. The Box Score tells you what every player did during the game.\nYou represent the game according to the needs of the audence. Mind you, no representation is the actual game itself.\nLearning how to represent the world using scientific statements and how to evaluate scientific statements is an important part of learning to be a physicist. That ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù is indirect, it‚Äôs not the thing. The ‚Äúsky is blue‚Äù is a word-statement. The frequency of the light in that sky overhead is about 750 nanometers is a mathematical statement. A spectrographic display is an image statement. None of these are the actual phenomenon, nor are they an explanation of what caused the phenomenon. They are facts and our knowledge of them is limited to how well we can support each of the statements as they all have uncertainties."

A fact can be an existence-thing and it can be a number.\nLet me take the second first. Here‚Äôs a fact: the mass of an electron is \\(9.109 \\times 10^{31}\\) kg. I measure that and so will you. It‚Äôs in books. It‚Äôs in Wikipedia!\nBut this will sound silly, but it‚Äôs maybe one of the most important and most misunderstood things about a scientific fact. If you go an measure the mass of an electron, you might get \\(9.1093837139 \\times 10^{31}\\) kg. Those aren‚Äôt the same number. You might correctly point out that they‚Äôre close and that the second one is maybe more precise and you‚Äôd be right. But what then is the proof of the fact that the electron has a particular mass?

It‚Äôs a number plus a declaration of how well I know that number‚Ä¶the ‚Äúuncertainty.‚Äù Thankfully now when political polls are announced, the ‚Äúmargin of error‚Äù is reported. So if one candidate‚Äôs poll number is 49% and the other is 51% with a margin of error of 4%‚Ä¶they are tied. Nobody can be reported to be ahead.\nThe same thing is true in a scientific ‚Äúfact‚Äù but besides the uncertainty inherent to the number of measurements (statistical uncertainty), there are uncertainties inherent to the measurement device used. If I have a ruler marked off in only whole inches, and I measure something to be 2.5 inches long, then there‚Äôs an inherent uncertainty in that measurement that‚Äôs a significant fraction of an inch.\nSo. Facts about the natural world cannot be proven in the same sense that a mathematical proof can be proven. So when being precise in our language, scientists do not speak of having proven a fact."

So really when one is evaluating the believability of a scientific idea‚Ä¶what you‚Äôre really evaluating is a set of statements about that idea. In everyday life, I might toss off a thought casually, without preparation or much analysis. You know, like in a normal conversation. But a scientific statement isn‚Äôt like that. It‚Äôs considered, it‚Äôs carefully put together, it‚Äôs thoughtful and meaningful. A scientific statement can be a sentence, or a whole book.

    "text": "0.8 It is not possible to test a theory. We test models.\nI‚Äôve discarded Laws and truth and proof and so it‚Äôs time to confront the idea of a theory and how we can trust one or not. ‚ÄúWhat is a theory,‚Äù is a valid question.\n\n0.8.1 Planes, Trains, and Automobiles: Models\nWhen I was a kid, I was consumed by models of cars‚Äî ‚Äúhot rods‚Äù of the 1960s. And airplanes. And HO train sets. In short, life-like replicas of transportation tools were my passion when I wasn‚Äôt playing or watching baseball.\nA plastic model stands for‚Äîrepresents‚Äîa real thing in the world, not perfectly, but well enough to complete a mission. In my case, that mission was a 13 year old boy imagining the car that he‚Äôd work on and own some day. If my plastic 1967 Chevy with baby moon wheels, GM 350 cubes with aluminum heads, Edelbrock intake manifold, Holley 4bbl, HPC Coated Headers w/Dual Exhaust, painted baby blue was made more and more precise, it would eventually become‚Ä¶a real car.\nchevybox.png intage Revell model ‚Äô57 Chevy. In the box.\nI‚Äôve been careful in what I wrote above to do two things. First, I referred to scientific statements and models of nature. Gone are the days when a physicist can construct a mathematical description of say a block of wood sliding down a plane of wood and proudly proclaim that what‚Äôs written in symbols on paper is a 1:1 faithful reproduction of what happens in the laboratory.\nNow we operate from a more hazy, removed vantage point. As we get into electric and magnetic fields, relativity, and quantum mechanics the correspondence between a mathematical description and what nature is supposed to be like will become necessarily more indirect and abstract.\nI now tend to think of a theory as a broad framework within which there are many ways to address nature from within the framework. But what we don‚Äôt do is test the theory, rather we build mathematical models that use the rules (from within the framework) of a theory to address a particular, well-defined piece of nature with predictions. Then experiments are done to test the model, not the theory.\nLet‚Äôs pick on Special Relativity again. I can tell you the Theory of Relativity in these three lines:\n\nThe rules of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe interval between two spacetime events is Minkowskian.\n\nThe first two statements are called the Postulates of Relativity and the last statement is a consequence of the mathematization of the theory in geometry.\nThis is the Theory of Relativity‚Ä¶the framework within which any scientific statement must fit. You don‚Äôt need to understand what these sentences mean, but you can surely see that they don‚Äôt contain a single mathematic equation. That‚Äôs where the models come in.\nIn my way of thinking, a mathematical model of nature is a little machine that you a result at the end when you add some information at the beginning. The result can be, and usually is, the prediction of what an experiment would find. That result can also be another equation, distilled from input equations.\nWe will use the Theory of Relativity above quite a bit, but our confrontation with nature will be through models that are built within the framework of the Theory of Relativity.\nAn important aspect of a model is that it must respect a possible measurement‚Äôs capabilities. A model is not meant to be a 1:1 representation of nature, just like the model car is not a real car. It‚Äôs a limited representation that can be tested. Here‚Äôs what I mean.\nI can create a model for how fast a block will move across a table if it‚Äôs pushed with a given force. If that‚Äôs all I want to know, that‚Äôs a pretty easy thing to predict. But notice that it‚Äôs not the whole story of what goes on. The table and the block heat up and so energy is lost to the warming air. There are billions of little, complex atomic bonds between the under-surface of the block and the table-top. There‚Äôs a lot of physics involved in describing this event and how much detail I include in the model depends on a) what I want to know from my measurement and b) how well I need to know it. My model could include all of those thermodynamic and atomic effects but I wouldn‚Äôt include them if I can‚Äôt measure the speed very precisely.\nPhysicists learn to stick to the Goldilocks Rule of Modeling. A model can‚Äôt be too crude and a model can‚Äôt be too precise‚Ä¶a model needs to be Just Right.\nTo summarize:\n\naccept a theory and its rules; build mathematical models within the theory to represent nature (but not in a 1:1 sense);\nmake predictions from those models and test them in experiments;\naccept or reject the model based on the results of the experiments.\n\nThat‚Äôs the game that I‚Äôve played for four decades in which I‚Äôve never left the theory of quantum mechanics, the theory of special relativity, nor the theory of general relativity‚Ä¶but I‚Äôve tested lots of models.\n\n0.8.1.1 Statements\nIt‚Äôs a detail, but an important one. We cannot test nature directly. We can only assess the truth or falsity only of statements. This reflects a remoteness of a scientist relative to nature itself. So a prediction and a test of that prediction is really testing statements and not theories and not nature. I confess this is hard to appreciate and I can probably argue even with myself about it.\npainting.png In some ways, what an artist does when she paints a landscape is make a model of it. Representation theory is a serious part of ‚ÄúSemiotics‚Äù which is a sophisticated discipline in philosophy, linguistics, and aesthetics.\n\n\n\n0.8.2 Memory Medicine: Confirmation and Disconfirmation\nIn my car I just heard an advertisement for a supplement that would make me remember things better. (I don‚Äôt remember its name‚Ä¶see what I did there?) It apparently has been ‚Äúproven‚Äù to be effective. Well, by now you know my problems with that word, but what is it that scientists can actually say about a model and indirectly, the theory framework within which it functions?\nThe black squirrel issue makes it clear that proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that an inductive model is true is risky and historically unproductive.\n\nThe word that we use when evidence supports a model‚Äôs prediction is ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù‚Ä¶the model‚Äôs prediction is confirmed, definately not ‚Äúproved.‚Äù\nThe word we use when a model‚Äôs prediction is contradicted is ‚Äúdisconfirmed.‚Äù\nThe burden of any model is that it must be ‚Äúfalsifiable‚Äù or in principle be disconfirmable.\n\nA couple of notes. ‚ÄúConfirm‚Äù is weaker than prove, leaving us the necessary freedom to allow that evidence can change our models and even theories. Those theories that I keep saying we trust? They have been confirmed many, many times. (It‚Äôs fair to think that maybe a Law is just a really, well-confirmed theory. But I‚Äôm fighting that older picture of Newtonian-like Laws.)\nThat last bullet is important and has a special place in the Philosophy of Science‚Äîand is the center of a couple of serious arguments in my fields of physics right now.\n\nYou might have heard some of this in the news and the falsifiability test of a theory (the word used then) is attributed to the philosopher, Karl Popper. He thought this was a worthy goal of science because showing something to be wrong is actually a deductive process, the inverse of showing that something agrees.\n\nTo a Popperian (my pejorative word) a single instance of disconfirmation should eliminate a model from study (they would say ‚Äútheory‚Äù). A single black squirrel? That‚Äôs nice sounding, but not how science actually works and is philosophically troublesome (ask Mr Google about the Duhem‚ÄìQuine thesis)‚Äìthat black squirrel could have just been in a dust-bin.\n\nThe requirement of falsifiability as a standard required of science has pretty much stuck with us.\n\nCan you see how this in-principle falsifiability requirement actually feeds my original assertion above about how to tell if a statement is scientific or not? The latter is just a simpler version of the former.\nThe bottom line here is this:\n\nThe burden on science is not to prove things about nature, but to confirm or disconfirm statements about nature.\n\nIn QS&BB, we‚Äôll watch revolutions in science that create large frameworks in which models are tested, rejected, and accepted. These frameworks I will call theories and I can list them for you:\n\nNewton‚Äôs laws of motion (remember?)\nNewton‚Äôs law of Gravitation\nMaxwell‚Äôs Theory of Electromagnetism\nQuantum Mechanics\nSpecial Relativity Theory\nThe General Theory of Relativity\n\nIn my picture, there are not many theories in physics.\nOther topics like the big bang? quarks? nuclear physics? the standard model of particle physics? These are all models within the currently acceptable theories (frameworks) of 4, 5, and 6 above. Numbers 1 and 2? They‚Äôve been replaced!\n\n\n0.8.3 Laziness: Belief\nOne more word that both has no place in science but is one of those words we use all the time: Belief. We all talk about what we believe (and don‚Äôt), and scientists will sometimes colloquially do that in a scientific context, but that‚Äôs sloppy. When I say ‚ÄúI believe in X,‚Äù what I really mean is that that job that word does is act as a shorthand for the sentence: ‚ÄúX is highly confirmed by experiments and X is likely to survive foreseeable experimental tests if asked.‚Äù If I‚Äôm an expert in the field of X, then I have the obligation to describe those experimental tests. If I‚Äôm not an expert in X and I want to echo an expert‚Äôs ‚Äúbelief,‚Äù I should expect that expert could also enumerate its experimental successes in detail on my behalf. (That‚Äôs a little tricky.)\nThere are dos and don‚Äôts here for scientists (and students of science). When it comes to belief in a scientific statement, I can‚Äôt do three things:\n\nI can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because I want to,\nI can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because my gut or a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù suggests that I should, and\nI can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because just because a non-expert or an authoritative text tells me to. Likewise, I can‚Äôt say that I don‚Äôt believe in X for any of those same three reasons."

The Nobel physicist from the University of Texas, Stephen Weinberg is both a prolific scientist, but also a writer of non-specialist books, the most famous being The First Three Minutes. One of his later books for the public is Dreams of a Final Theory and his last chapter is called Against Philosophy where he notes, ‚ÄúI know how philosophers feel about attempts by scientists at amateur philosophy. But I do not aim here to play the role of a philosopher, but rather that of a specimen, an unregenerate working scientist who finds no help in professional philosophy. I am not alone in this; I know of no one who has participated actively in the advance of physics in the postwar period whose research has been significantly helped by the work of philosophers.‚Äù\nOne of the more disturbing ways in which philosophy of science has drifted is in the denial of the project of science as learning about the physical world.

    "text": "2.1 Laws?\nIn the 1970s there was an unpopular national speed limit of 55 mph and the catch-phrase used to encourage compliance was: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not just a good idea, it‚Äôs the law.‚Äô That‚Äôs one interpretation of a law ‚Äì you can obey or choose not to. But then there is the common expectation for Scientific Laws‚Ä¶certain, indisputable, irrefutable statements. Epic in their cosmic importance.\nThe popular notion of a Scientific Law is a statement that‚Äôs impossible to dispute: once it‚Äôs discovered, it‚Äôs almost biblical in its permanence. Once you‚Äôve found a Law, man, you‚Äôre done. That‚Äôs it. That Law is way better than a theory. Go do something else.\nThis ‚ÄúLaw‚Äù was incorporated into the description of physics following Isaac Newton‚Äôs almost super-human successes. Surely, he‚Äôd uncovered the God-given Laws of Nature and surely uncovering the Laws of Nature is now the goal of science. You‚Äôll see all manner of ‚ÄúLaws‚Äù that follow Newton‚Äôs three Laws of Motion and Newton‚Äôs Gravitational Law: Snell‚Äôs Law, The First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics, the Law of Reflection, Faraday‚Äôs Law, Ampere‚Äôs Law‚Ä¶and so on, up to the 20th century when we got serious.\nFrom that point, it‚Äôs Einstein‚Äôs Special Theory of Relativity, Einstein‚Äôs General Theory of Relativity, Quantum Theory, Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau Theory, Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Theory, Relativistic Quantum Field Theory, Inflation Theory, the Big Bang Theory, and so on. Are we just dumber than when all of science was uncovering Laws? No.¬†Rather, around the turn of the 20th century the subtlety of science is was sinking in. But apparently not in Florida. onlytheory\nLet me tell you a story.\nThe speed of light\nWe‚Äôll spend a lot of effort becoming comfortable with Einstein‚Äôs Theory of Relativity. One of its famous, bedrock rules is that the speed of light is the fastest that anything can travel. (BTW, that‚Äôs technically a ‚Äúpostulate,‚Äù not a law.) Relativity has been confirmed so many times that we use it as a tool and not a theory to be tested‚Ä¶Florida should call it the Law of Relativity. But we don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the Theory of Relativity.\n\nThere is an elementary particle called the neutrino that is so light that it travels at almost the speed of light. In 2011 an experiment called Opera in a mountain in northern Italy was under way to measure properties of neutrinos coming from the CERN particle accelerator in Geneva, Switzerland, almost 1000 km away.\nIn order to be sure of the source of interactions, Opera had a sophisticated GPS system that measured times in Geneva and times in the mountain at a precision better than ¬±0.000000010 seconds (¬±10 nanoseconds). What they found was that the neutrinos appeared to arrive faster than the speed of light would allow, apparently violating the Theory of Relativity!\nIf Relativity were a Law of Nature in the Florida-way, say the ‚ÄúLaw of Relativity‚Äù‚Äîthen the surprising Opera measurement would have confronted the authority of the Law of Relativity and the scientists would back down: can‚Äôt cross that threshold of Law. But Opera scientists couldn‚Äôt do that. The experimenters worked very hard to redo their analyses and scoured their experimental apparatus for any place that the few nanoseconds might have been missing.\nI was a member of the Physics Advisory Committee at the Fermi National Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois which was running a similar experiment, shooting neutrinos from Illinois to a mine in northern Minnesota. We asked them and learned that they too saw an effect, but they used a conventional GPS and they couldn‚Äôt measure times precisely enough to test Opera‚Ä¶ so we bought them a fancy ‚Äì expensive ‚Äì GPS system so they could check! Meanwhile many alternative explanations around Relativity were proposed to account for the measurement. Many, many. A small theoretical physics industry of alternative ideas.\nAfter a year or so, Opera discovered a subtle, tiny, but flawed optical fiber seating that accounted for the missing few nanoseconds and then were able to conclude that Einstein could rest easy. Meanwhile, Fermilab had a shiny, new GPS system.\n\nYou get the important part of this story? Relativity is among the most trusted theories in all of science ‚Äî if anything could be labeled as ‚ÄúLaw‚Äù then this is it! And yet, when faced with an apparent problem, we had to dig deeper.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nüìù The authority of Relativity is not absolute, it‚Äôs not Law-like, but a highly trusted theory.\n\n\nI was proud of my community during that episode. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to work. There are no Laws of the capital L kind."

    "text": "2.2 My criterion for a proper scientific statement\nI‚Äôm treading into waters that force us to think about what is and what isn‚Äôt a proper scientific process. Historically. that‚Äôs the problem of demarcating Scientific Knowledge from ‚Äúpseudo-science‚Äù statements. You may have heard that scientific statements must be ‚Äúfalsifiable,‚Äù an idea often credited to the philosopher of science (and other things), Karl Popper3\nHere‚Äôs my personal rule:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nü´µ In order for you to assert a statement about the natural world as legitimately scientific, you must be able to say what it would take to change your mind.\n\n\n\nNobody said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs ignore this evidence because Relativity must be true.‚Äù We all said, ‚ÄúWow. A faster-than-light neutrino signal is probably a mistake but we‚Äôd better spend a year around the world checking it.‚Äù\n\nüëç Proponents of scientific statements can always tell you what evidence would force them to abandon one of their favorite theories, here, a superluminal particle qualifies as one of those pieces of evidence that could in-principle have overthrown Relativity.\nüëé Proponents of unscientific statements cannot ‚Äì or will not ‚Äì do that. The most obvious contemporary example of unscientific assertions are those that come from creationism or ‚Äúintelligent design.‚Äù Unlike the Opera experience, proponents of these systems of belief hold that some parts of their knowledge live in territory that is off-limits for questioning.\n\nWait. Why shouldn‚Äôt students be taught both sides of such a disagreement about our origins?\nGlad you asked. That‚Äôs now called ‚Äúteach the controversy‚Äú and it‚Äôs not appropriate in a science class for two reasons. First, to put creationism in a science class goes against that crucial falsifiability requirement. So it‚Äôs not science. Second, science is not a democracy. There‚Äôs no requirement in how the universe works that it make people happy. It is what it is.\n\nIf you believe that ‚ÄúX‚Äù cannot be doubted? Then X may be some form of knowledge, but it‚Äôs not scientific knowledge.\n\nWait. What about Newtonian Gravitation! It‚Äôs used today even to determine satellite and spacecraft trajectories.  Glad you asked. A tiny bit of display math can answer that I hope\n\nHere is Newton‚Äôs Gravitational law (see what I did there? law not Law):\n\\[F = G\\frac{M_1M_2}{R_{12}}\\]\nIn words, this formula says that the force of gravitational attraction between two objects that have masses of \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\) and whose centers are separated by the distance \\(R_{12}\\) is that relationship. Let‚Äôs look at each piece:\n\n\\(G\\) is called the gravitational constant (or Newton‚Äôs constant). It‚Äôs very hard to measure and as a resut it‚Äôs the worst measured constant of nature of all. A question of scientific research today.\n\\(M\\) is the mass‚Ä¶which is a very complicated concept. As we speake, we are at work at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland trying to understand mass. A question of scientific research today.\n\\(R^2\\) ‚Ä¶that ‚Äú2‚Äù in the formula is a direct consequence of the presumption that we have three dimensions of space. It‚Äôs a measurable quantity ‚Äì and is not very precisely determined and the notion that we have three and not more spacial dimensions is a question of scientific research today.\n\nSo every term in Newton‚Äôs Gravatation law is uncertain and theoretically of interest. Again, Laws shouldn‚Äôt do that.\n\nWait. So, what can you believe in?  Glad you asked. That‚Äôs an understandable concern for folks who don‚Äôt do science for a living. We have theories and they are all questionable. We must live in a world that is full of uncertainty and a scientific world where no idea is permanent. I suspect that‚Äôs uncomfortable for many but it‚Äôs our lives.\n\nSo ‚Äútheories all the way down‚Äù really means that we have a few theories that we trust very well and we don‚Äôt question them now unless a surprise happens. And we have many theories that are not trusted as much. So not turtles all the way down, but theories of varying degrees of trustworthiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nüìù In QS&BB we‚Äôll work with the nuts and bolts of science: theories and models and this site will consist of the stories of how theories came to be, how they were modified, how they disappeared, and how we know so much more about the universe as a result."

Everyone knows what a fact is, right? Well it‚Äôs a fact that Joe Friday never said that line in the TV program, but ask anyone over the age of 60 and chances are that they will agree that it‚Äôs a fact that Detective Friday uttered that line in every episode. But he didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs an urban myth born of a popular 1953 spoof of the program, Little Blue Riding Hood. Google it and listen (it‚Äôs only 3 minutes).\n‚ÄúFact‚Äù is another one of those words. You might want to say that science consists of facts arranged in order to support or define theories‚Ä¶or just collect data or artifacts. There‚Äôs an assumption built into that sentiment: on the one hand there are facts about the world and on the other hand, there are opinions about the world and science works hard to separate the two‚Ä¶and reserve ‚Äúfacts‚Äù as the fuel for theories and guard against opinion from influencing that process. That‚Äôs the case. But like Law, this burden given to ‚Äúfact‚Äù sometimes assigns to it the responsibility of being a ‚Äútrue thing.‚Äù But even in everyday life, let alone in nearly every crime novel ever written, facts depend on evidence and evidence is a set of informed observations. And observations change, they evolve, or they can be mistaken.\nA plausible-sounding, if simplified cartoon of the scientific method might be: evidence \\(\\to\\) facts \\(\\to\\) Laws. But if Laws are not forever, where in this chain does uncertainty sneak in? Obviously, it‚Äôs that evidence and facts are not permanent. It was a fact that the evidence pointed to the fact that all objects move slower than the speed of light, but when the evidence appeared to change we were prepared to dispute the theory and so Relativity as a Law in the Florida-sense didn‚Äôt fit.\nMore appropriate is a chain that goes like: evidence \\(\\to\\) facts \\(\\to\\) theories. And then depending on the accumulation of the evidence that justify the facts, we have theories we trust a lot and theories we‚Äôre just beginning to get to know. But since evidence is contingent, facts are contingent, and so theories are contingent. Any or all can change and it takes a professional scientist to know when to pull the plug on any one of them."

Here it is in its formal layout:\n\nAll men are mortal.\nSocrates is a man.\nTherefore, Socrates is mortal.\n\nThe power of this is not about Socrates, but the general nature of the form of the argument. It‚Äôs mathematical in nature. Do you remember the ‚Äútransitive property‚Äù of arithmetic? If \\(A = B\\) and \\(B=C\\) then \\(A=C\\)? This is precisely the same story about Socrates but dressed up to look like middle school math without any reference to a gadfly philosopher or the species of men. Within the tight little universe of the assertions and the conclusion, there is no room for dispute in a deductive argument: Socrates can be nothing but mortal, \\(A\\) cannot be anything but \\(C\\).\nSince deduction is how you go from one point to the next in a proof, it‚Äôs easy to see why ‚Äúproof‚Äù carries a heavy responsibility and that‚Äôs the problem with using the word ‚Äúproof‚Äù in a scientific context.\nRene Descartes in the 17th century was the paradigm deduction champion at the beginning of modern western philosophy and tried to take that method into physics (which was called natural philosophy). Newton was at first a fan, but then changed his tune.\nDo you learn anything new from a deductive proof? In going from premises to conclusion nothing entered the process that wasn‚Äôt already there to begin with, so the conclusion seems to be ‚Äúinside‚Äù of the premises all along! This was so important to Plato, that he decided that one already knows mathematics and that you are actually remembering things in a deductive proof that you already knew. You‚Äôd just forgotten.\nJust to be perverse, here‚Äôs another syllogism of exactly the same form as the previous one:\n\nAll frogs are coffee pots.\nThis animal is a frog.\nTherefore, this animal is a coffee pot.\n\nThis has exactly the same validity as the Socrates example‚Äîit fits the Venn diagram. But nobody would accuse a frog of being a kitchen appliance. Obviously, the viability of the premises in a deductive argument makes the whole thing sensible‚Ä¶or nonsense. Dare I ask, is it a fact that frogs are coffee pots? If it were so, then the syllogism is not only formally correct, but also leads to a reasonable conclusion about green amphibians.\nDoes science work this way? There was a time in the 17th and 18th century‚Äîthe ‚ÄúScientific Revolution‚Äù time‚Äîwhen marvels were being unearthed and thousands of years-old puzzles were being explained. The successes were so impressive that it came to be appreciated that maybe this new invention of science must be taking us directly to nature‚Äôs truths. We now know that science is not that clean.\nBefore I moved to East Lansing I‚Äôd seen lots of squirrels in my life. They were all brown and I had created a Theory of Squirrels in my brain that said, ‚ÄúAll squirrels are brown.‚Äù Indeed, I would have said that it was a fact that squirrels are brown and that fact was justified by my many observations of squirrels, all of which were brown. That‚Äôs lots of squirrels.\nImagine my surprise in 1980 when I saw hundreds of black squirrels in my new Michigan town. My justification took a turn for the worse. My theory of squirrels was defeated. (Luckily I‚Äôd not announced a Law of Squirrels!) I later learned that the black squirrel had been intentionally brought to the Michigan State campus in the 1950s and obviously spread to town. So if I‚Äôd moved to Michigan in the 1940‚Äôs my theory of squirrels would have received continued justification.\nI was reminded that reasoning by induction is risky and that facts can change.\nRemember induction? It‚Äôs ‚Äúthe other‚Äù form of reasoning where you observe a pattern or some process over and over‚Äîmaybe under controlled (scientific?) conditions‚Äîand then abstract from those observations to a general statement of fact. The facts are a statement of what I know up until now, but my theory is a framework that permits me to predict the future. You can imagine that for the first 30 years of my life I was constantly uttering:\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a brown squirrel.\nThere‚Äôs another brown squirrel.\nThere‚Äôs another brown squirrel.\nThere‚Äôs another brown squirrel.\nThere‚Äôs another brown squirrel.‚Äù\nIn my 20‚Äôs maybe: ‚ÄúIt is a fact that my observed squirrels are all brown.‚Äù\nThen, triumphantly, ‚ÄúMy theory of squirrels is that all squirrels are brown.‚Äù\nThat‚Äôs induction. But a theory that comes from induction is subject to modification or even rejection since only a single instance can disappoint. (By the way, I‚Äôd insist that every observation of a brown squirrel was factual! I was justified in every observation that brownness was what that squirrel presented to me.\nCertainly there‚Äôs a lot of induction in science. In fact Galileo‚Äôs contemporary and correspondent Francis Bacon enthusiastically built a case for science based on induction‚Äîat about the same time that Descartes did the same thing for deduction. Both have their uses today. A mathematical physicist is likely to be deducing consequences of theories and models, an experimental physicist is likely to be inductively drawing conclusions from patterns in data, while that same experimental physicist is likely to be using deduction in the process of debugging malfunctioning equipment, and an electrical engineer or scientist designing digital electronic circuits will be deeply immersed in the individual components in a circuit that explicitly uses deductive logic.\nSo one logical size doesn‚Äôt fit all, but it‚Äôs even more interesting. A case can be made that the process that‚Äôs closest to a recognizable science is the form of reasoning called abduction which is more like what a detective does, at least in fiction. One reasons to the most likely conclusion. You do this all the time:\n\nSuppose your car won‚Äôt start. There are a thousand reasons why that be the case: it could be fairies, it could be an evil spell, it could be a prank from your roommate (who‚Äôs always a pain), it could be that your battery is old and you listened to the radio last night after shutting off the engine, it could be that you‚Äôre out of gas. Because of a variety of experiences you‚Äôve had regarding mystical creatures, magic, the fact that your roommate is out of town, how batteries are rumored to work, and that you‚Äôd filled your tank the day before would cause you to abduct to the conclusion that your battery is probably discharged because of its age. Abduction is the most recognizable form of reasoning that scientists generally engage in. It involves expertise, it is not iron-clad (you could have a leak in your gas tank), and it‚Äôs not based on a string of observations like brown squirrels.\n\n\nWas Sherlock Holmes the Master of Deduction? Nope. He was the Master of Abduction.\n\nCan you imagine that it‚Äôs hard to be sure? Absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, sure about something that‚Äôs discovered in nature? We cannot be. The assumption about frogs and coffee pots might have come from an abductive process, and a chain of deductive logic might lead you to a conclusion that you‚Äôd like to declare is a true statement about nature. But we‚Äôd have been wrong.\nWe‚Äôll see below that what we test are models of nature. The consequences of a model are deductive in that the chain of reasoning leads from assumptions to what should happen in the future‚Äîa prediction. It‚Äôs those pesky assumptions that make the whole process contingent and impermanent: no absolute truth and certainly no proof. I‚Äôll leave you with this:\n\nParticles cannot go faster than the speed of light.\nNeutrinos are particles.\nNeutrinos cannot go faster than the speed of light.\n\nHad we taken that first premise to be indisputable‚Äîtrue forever and ever and beyond questioning‚Äîthen we would not have taken the Opera claim seriously. But that‚Äôs not how science works and not what the community did. We worked hard to find evidence that the first premise was not a fact (that maybe it was a black squirrel). We‚Äôre now more trusting of the conclusion about the speed of light which wouldn‚Äôt have occurred without that nervous year."

    "text": "8.1 It is not possible to test a theory. We test models.\nI‚Äôve discarded Laws and truth and proof and so it‚Äôs time to confront the idea of a theory and how we can trust one or not. ‚ÄúWhat is a theory,‚Äù is a valid question.\nI‚Äôve thought about this a lot. We have an idea of what a theory is, but do we directly test a theory? I don‚Äôt think so. I think we make models following the rules and suggestions of a theory and we then we test the model. I‚Äôll try to explain why. Beware that this may be controversial‚Ä¶it‚Äôs my idea that may not have occurred to others unless they‚Äôve been condemned to this dual life that I have of both a scientific and philosophical education. It‚Äôs a living, but it‚Äôs not easy.\n\n8.1.1 Planes, Trains, and Automobiles: Models\nWhen I was a kid, I was consumed by models of cars‚Äî ‚Äúhot rods‚Äù of the 1960s. And airplanes. And HO train sets. In short, life-like replicas of transportation tools were my passion when I wasn‚Äôt playing or watching baseball.\nA plastic model stands for‚Äîrepresents‚Äîa real thing in the world, not perfectly, but well enough to complete a mission. In my case, that mission was a 13 year old boy imagining the car that he‚Äôd work on and own some day. If my plastic 1967 Chevy with baby moon wheels, GM 350 cubes with aluminum heads, Edelbrock intake manifold, Holley 4bbl, HPC Coated Headers w/Dual Exhaust, painted baby blue was made more and more precise, it would eventually become‚Ä¶a real car.\nchevybox.png intage Revell model ‚Äô57 Chevy. In the box.\nI‚Äôve been careful in what I wrote in other posts to do two things. First, I referred to scientific statements and models of nature. Gone are the days when a physicist can construct a mathematical description of say a block of wood sliding down a plane of wood and proudly proclaim that what‚Äôs written in symbols on paper is a 1:1 faithful reproduction of what happens in the laboratory.\nNow we operate from a more hazy, removed vantage point. As we consider electric and magnetic fields, relativity, and quantum mechanics the correspondence between a mathematical description and what nature is supposed to be like will become necessarily more indirect and abstract.\nI now tend to think of a theory as a broad framework within which there are many ways to address nature from within the framework. But what we don‚Äôt do is test the theory, rather we build mathematical models that use the rules (from within the framework) of a theory to address a particular, well-defined piece of nature with predictions. Then experiments are done to test the model, not the theory.\nLet‚Äôs pick on Special Relativity again. I can tell you the Theory of Relativity in these three lines:\n\nThe rules of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe interval between two spacetime events is Minkowskian.\n\nThe first two statements are called the Postulates of Relativity and the last statement is a consequence of the mathematization of the theory in geometry.\nThis is the Theory of Relativity‚Ä¶the framework within which any scientific statement must fit. You don‚Äôt need to understand what these sentences mean, but you can surely see that they don‚Äôt contain a single mathematic equation. That‚Äôs where the models come in.\nIn my way of thinking, a mathematical model of nature is a little machine that you run to a result at the end when you add some information at the beginning. The result can be, and usually is, the prediction of what an experiment would find. That result can also be another equation, distilled from input equations.\nWe will use the Theory of Relativity quite a bit, but our confrontation with nature will be through models that are built within the framework of the Theory of Relativity.\nAn important aspect of a model is that it must respect a possible measurement‚Äôs capabilities. A model is not meant to be a 1:1 representation of nature, just like the model car is not a real car. It‚Äôs a limited representation that can be tested. Here‚Äôs what I mean.\nI can create a model for how fast a block will move across a table if it‚Äôs pushed with a given force. If that‚Äôs all I want to know, that‚Äôs a pretty easy thing to predict. But notice that it‚Äôs not the whole story of what goes on. The table and the block heat up and so energy is lost to the warming air. There are billions of little, complex atomic bonds between the under-surface of the block and the table-top. There‚Äôs a lot of physics involved in describing this event and how much detail I include in the model depends on a) what I want to know from my measurement and b) how well I need to know it. My model could include all of those thermodynamic and atomic effects but I wouldn‚Äôt include them if I can‚Äôt measure the speed very precisely.\nPhysicists learn to stick to the Goldilocks Rule of Modeling. A model can‚Äôt be too crude and a model can‚Äôt be too precise‚Ä¶a model needs to be Just Right.\nTo summarize:\n\naccept a theory and its rules; build mathematical models within the theory to represent nature (but not in a 1:1 sense);\nmake predictions from those models and test them in experiments;\naccept or reject the model based on the results of the experiments.\n\nThat‚Äôs the game that I‚Äôve played for four decades in which I‚Äôve never left the theory of quantum mechanics, the theory of special relativity, nor the theory of general relativity‚Ä¶but I‚Äôve tested lots of models.\n\n8.1.1.1 Statements\nIt‚Äôs a detail, but an important one. We cannot test nature directly. We can only assess the truth or falsity only of statements. This reflects a remoteness of a scientist relative to nature itself. So a prediction and a test of that prediction is really testing statements and not theories and not nature. I confess this is hard to appreciate and I can probably argue even with myself about it.\npainting.png In some ways, what an artist does when she paints a landscape is make a model of it. Representation theory is a serious part of ‚ÄúSemiotics‚Äù which is a sophisticated discipline in philosophy, linguistics, and aesthetics.\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Memory Medicine: Confirmation and Disconfirmation\nIn my car I just heard an advertisement for a supplement that would make me remember things better. (I don‚Äôt remember its name‚Ä¶see what I did there?) It apparently has been ‚Äúproven‚Äù to be effective. Well, by now you know my problems with that word, but what is it that scientists can actually say about a model and indirectly, the theory framework within which it functions?\nThe black squirrel issue makes it clear that proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that an inductive model is true is risky and historically unproductive.\n\nThe word that we use when evidence supports a model‚Äôs prediction is ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù‚Ä¶the model‚Äôs prediction is confirmed, definately not ‚Äúproved.‚Äù\nThe word we use when a model‚Äôs prediction is contradicted is ‚Äúdisconfirmed.‚Äù\nThe burden of any model is that it must be ‚Äúfalsifiable‚Äù or in principle be disconfirmable.\n\nA couple of notes. ‚ÄúConfirm‚Äù is weaker than prove, leaving us the necessary freedom to allow that evidence can change our models and even theories. Those theories that I keep saying we trust? They have been confirmed many, many times. (It‚Äôs fair to think that maybe a Law is just a really, well-confirmed theory. But I‚Äôm fighting that older picture of Newtonian-like Laws.)\nThat last bullet is important and has a special place in the Philosophy of Science‚Äîand is the center of a couple of serious arguments in my fields of physics right now.\n\nYou might have heard some of this in the news and the falsifiability test of a theory (the word used then) is attributed to the philosopher, Karl Popper. He thought this was a worthy goal of science because showing something to be wrong is actually a deductive process, the inverse of showing that something agrees.\n\nTo a Popperian (my pejorative word) a single instance of disconfirmation should eliminate a model from study (they would say ‚Äútheory‚Äù). A single black squirrel? That‚Äôs nice sounding, but not how science actually works and is philosophically troublesome (ask Mr Google about the Duhem‚ÄìQuine thesis)‚Äìthat black squirrel could have just been in a dust-bin.\n\nThe requirement of falsifiability as a standard required of science has pretty much stuck with us.\n\nCan you see how this in-principle falsifiability requirement actually feeds my original assertion above about how to tell if a statement is scientific or not? The latter is just a simpler version of the former.\nThe bottom line here is this:\n\nThe burden on science is not to prove things about nature, but to confirm or disconfirm statements about nature.\n\nIn QS&BB, we‚Äôll watch revolutions in science that create large frameworks in which models are tested, rejected, and accepted. These frameworks I will call theories and I can list them for you:\n\nNewton‚Äôs laws of motion (remember?)\nNewton‚Äôs law of Gravitation\nMaxwell‚Äôs Theory of Electromagnetism\nQuantum Mechanics\nSpecial Relativity Theory\nThe General Theory of Relativity\n\nIn my picture, there are not many theories in physics.\nOther topics like the big bang? quarks? nuclear physics? the standard model of particle physics? These are all models within the currently acceptable theories (frameworks) of 4, 5, and 6 above. Numbers 1 and 2? They‚Äôve been replaced!\n\n\n8.1.3 Laziness: Belief\nOne more word that both has no place in science but is one of those words we use all the time: Belief. We all talk about what we believe (and don‚Äôt), and scientists will sometimes colloquially do that in a scientific context, but that‚Äôs sloppy. When I say ‚ÄúI believe in X,‚Äù what I really mean is that that job that word does is act as a shorthand for the sentence: ‚ÄúX is highly confirmed by experiments and X is likely to survive foreseeable experimental tests if asked.‚Äù If I‚Äôm an expert in the field of X, then I have the obligation to describe those experimental tests. If I‚Äôm not an expert in X and I want to echo an expert‚Äôs ‚Äúbelief,‚Äù I should expect that expert could also enumerate its experimental successes in detail on my behalf. (That‚Äôs a little tricky.)\nThere are dos and don‚Äôts here for scientists (and students of science). When it comes to belief in a scientific statement, I can‚Äôt do three things:\n\nI can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because I want to,\nI can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because my gut or a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù suggests that I should, and\nI can‚Äôt say that I believe in X because just because a non-expert or an authoritative text tells me to. Likewise, I can‚Äôt say that I don‚Äôt believe in X for any of those same three reasons"

They would have been taught that if you can‚Äôt see it, then it can‚Äôt be real. To claim otherwise would be absurd. Chemists spoke of atoms, but were disdainful of anyone who thought they were real. They were just a shorthand picture for how to visualize elements. Physicists were even less flexible.\n\n\n2.2 The inside for my parents.\nFor people of my parents‚Äô generation, the answer would have been ‚Äúprotons, neutrons, and electrons.‚Äù The atom had been thrust into believability around the turn of the century, and then refined during the next two decades. But the neat planet-like picture of the atom was where it all stopped for many.\n\n\n2.3 The inside ‚Ä¶for us!\nIn our generation, the answer to the ‚Äúsmallest‚Äù question has been ‚Äúquarks and leptons‚Äù ‚Ä¶but we fully expect that they are not the end of the ‚Äúsmallest‚Äù story. We‚Äôre hard at work, even as we speak with brand new tools to explore further than ever before.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a computer reconstruction of the collision of two protons at the Large Hadron Collider. The ATLAS experiment is one of two gargantian ‚Äòdetectors‚Äô that catches the debris from these energetic collisions. The figure shows how two quarks in each of the colliding protons bounce off from one another and emerge in two collimated ‚Äòjets‚Äô of debris as they rip through the detector. The view is from the side and the lengths of these jets is each about 30 feet long. The length that the colliding quarks probed is about 0.000000000000000018 meters. This is today‚Äôs answer to the ‚Äòhow small‚Äô question.\n\n\n\nMaybe in your generation? The sky‚Äôs the limit! We‚Äôve hints at solving some old puzzles and we‚Äôll undoubtedly find new ones. We‚Äôre developing and deploying amazing new instruments and theoretical ideas now rub shoulders with not just nature, but philosophy and the deepest questions asked by humans. Your generation is going to see amazing things.\nThrough decades of intense experimentation and imaginative theorizing, the tiniest bits of reality are turning out to be a fascinating collection of objects. In the 1950s and 1960s, we just stood back and tried to catch the hundreds of particles that our experiments spit out at us. New particles every year! Names that nobody could remember. Hundreds of them, which was ludicrous! Didn‚Äôt nature have some plan?\n\n‚ÄúQuarks‚Äù? ‚ÄúLeptons‚Äù? Lots of jargon and I‚Äôll keep it all straight for you as we go along.For now, quarks are itsy-bitsy pieces of the proton and leptons include the electron and others. New states of matter might be: ‚Äúadditional quarks, the Higgs Boson, Supersymmetric Particles, Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), Dark Matter particles‚Ä¶‚Äù all famous candidates for future discovery. Of course whenever we get too cocky, nature plots to surprise us with something completely unexpected‚Äîmore often than we‚Äôd like to admit! So, we‚Äôre instinctively wary of being too sure of what‚Äôs coming.\n\nThe good news is that we‚Äôve uncovered a model that‚Äôs a very good picture of how much of the fundamental particles of the universe work together and we‚Äôve been exploring it since the 1970s. We‚Äôve knitted that earlier mess together into a coherent picture of the entities themselves as well as the rules that govern how that stuff behaves. But we‚Äôre unhappy. Our grand synthesis of the Tiniest Bits Story‚Äîcalled the Standard Model ‚Äî needs some polishing. Or more. While it‚Äôs been the gold-standard of the successful scientific theory, we expect that new tiny bits are lurking in our experiments and we will be astonished if nothing shows up as we dig deeper. This new anticipation would have been met with blank stares only a couple of decades ago.\nSo much for the inside effort."

Everything visible in the night sky was thought to be a part of one big, but still cozy cluster of stars which we see to be densest around the southern sky (from North America). Not only was my grandparents‚Äô universe compact, it was supposed to be permanent‚Äîstatic and unchanging‚Äî built of three kinds of objects: planets, stars, and clusters of stars. Stars twinkled, planets were steadfastly bright, and clusters of stars were fuzzy, indicative of their presumed distances from us. Sure, they all moved with regularity during each night and shifted slightly in a year, but the large scale structure of my grandparents‚Äô universe was simple: a nice, intimate, dependable universe.\n\n\n3.2 The outside for my parents.\nFor people of my parents‚Äô generation, the universe suddenly became huge.

Every spot is a galaxy, some nearby and some at the edge of our ability to see. ```\nIn this remarkable galactic family photograph the youngest galaxy imaged is 13.2 billion years old. We see it as it was when its light left its surface, on the way to the Hubble‚Äôs camera. It‚Äôs also a time when the universe was much smaller than it is now. This picture is today‚Äôs answer to the ‚Äúbiggest thing‚Äù question.\n\n\n3.3 The outside for us.\nBut, the real shocker was the overthrow of the static universe of my grandparents era. My parents‚Äô universe was found to be flying apart‚Äîexpanding‚Äîat a breakneck speed. No longer a tight-knit, stable thing‚Ä¶the universe is now huge and reckless. The really unsettling piece of news for my generation is that the Big Questions of antiquity are now legitimate scientific research programs: Was there a beginning to the universe? Are we alone? Will the universe end? Are there other universes? Was there anything before The Beginning? What drives the expansion of our universe to accelerate? The outside crowd thinks big thoughts now and this is a development of only the last couple of decades.\nWhen I was in graduate school, a professor told me that Cosmology was ‚Äúphysics knitting.‚Äù Not any more! Cosmology in my and especially your generation is going to be flat-out amazing!\n\nAn Auspicious Beginning\n\nYes. The observable universe had a beginning, and quite a beginning it must have been: it was a roiling mess of radiation and elementary particles at temperatures never to be seen again. Everything that is‚Äîspace, time, and all of energy‚Äîwould have been confined into a size smaller than a baseball. Unthinkably dense and with growth that was stunningly rapid, our early universe defies imagination. It‚Äôs so outrageous that comprehending it seems a job for fiction and not science, yet my generation has also found ways to explore it: we probe it through direct telescope observations and we remake it in particle collisions. This is the blending of the outside with the inside pictures that motivates me.\n\nWait. I don‚Äôt believe in the big bang. You appear to, but isn‚Äôt what you think just another ‚Äúbelief‚Äù? Aren‚Äôt we each entitled to our own beliefs?  Glad you asked. ‚ÄúBelief‚Äù is a tricky word that we all use, although in our context, we should be clear and I‚Äôll try to do that in the next lesson."

    "text": "How science works can be tricky and everyone has an opinion. The Nature of Science (NOS) is its own discpline across philosophy, history, sociology, and science itself.\nSince I‚Äôll be talking about old and new ideas, I thought I should try to put down my views on NOS from my physics-perspective. Below is a sketch to be fleshed out in separate posts with links below.\n\n\nI think that the term scientific ‚ÄúLaw‚Äù is misleading because it implies a fancy üéì permanence and universality, running counter to the fact that science is contingent ‚Äì Laws are subject to change, and that‚Äôs not the picture that many people have. Laws are forever!\nSo we don‚Äôt do Law any more. We do theories and models ‚Äì at least I do üòé. That‚Äôs because the distinction between a Law of physics and a theory of physics is often often misunderstood. (See in the menu bar ‚òùÔ∏è my gripe in just a theory? .)\n\n\nI think that the common idea about a theory is that it is a set of guesses or hunches. We all do it: have a theory as to why that tree fell down (‚ÄúIt was leaning and it was really windy.‚Äù)\nThis everyday-sense leads to the a mistaken notion that theories are somehow less than laws. Since I‚Äôve aleready set aside ‚Äúlaws‚Äù as unhelpful, let me try to explain what my notion of theories are.\nA scientific theory is a framework that can have three jobs:\n\nExplain observed phenomena.\nTie together ideas that once seemed unrelated.\nPredict new phenomena ‚Äì while being consistent with previously successes. (Ask Mr Google about Immanuel Velikovsky and Venus.)\n\nWe‚Äôre guided by theories, but we test mathematical models.\nHere‚Äôs more with some examples: 1.00 laws\n\n\n\n\nWhen we make mathematical models, they are very specific. They consist of inputs and some calculational process ‚Äì¬†an algorithm if you will, that tests an idea. Maybe you remember ‚Äúturning the crank‚Äù in a school calculation.\nWhat comes out after ‚Äúturning the crank‚Äù is a function, a number, a plot, an expected state of matter in the form of a scientific statement. This, a theory cannot do. The result can refer to something previously known (an explanation) or to something to be tested (a prediction).\nHere‚Äôs more detail: 5.00 models and scientific statements\n\n\n\nScientific knowledge is a bit special. It‚Äôs easy for us in everyday life to spontaneously decide that we ‚Äúknow‚Äù something ‚Äì¬†until we learn that we were were wrong! And that‚Äôs not a problem, it happens.\nBut scientific knowledge is different and we expect a lot from it. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äôbelief‚Äù which is personal and often unjustifiable. In fact, while it sounds scientific, ‚ÄúI believe in evolution‚Äù is not a scientific statement. Belief is not justifiable in scientific language.\nThe grammar of scientific knowledge is scientific statements.\n\n\nA scientific statement is not casual talk. It‚Äôs an assertion of something that‚Äôs checkable and it‚Äôs either what a model generates or how a scientific process is later described for the public. In both cases it‚Äôs open to scrutiny, and speaks a language that is within the norms of the scientific community (admitedly, a tough thing to define).\nWhatever comes out of a model‚Äôs crank-turning is a scientific statement in a form that can be compared with an experiment: they can be sentences, a mathematical function, the prediction of a state of matter, or a numerical fact.\nThat‚Äôs sort of an active job, but it can also do the work of reporting on results and there it has similar requirements. To say that ‚ÄúThe value of the Newtonian constant of gravitation is \\(6.674 30 \\times 10^{-11}\\) m\\(^3\\) kg\\(^{-1}\\) s\\(^{-2}\\).‚Äù is not a scientfic statement. Rather, The value of the Newtonian constant of gravitation is \\(6.674 30 \\times 10^{-11} \\pm 0.00015\\) m\\(^3\\) kg\\(^{-1}\\) s\\(^{-2}\\).‚Äù is a scientific statement. You see, higher standards.\nIf my scientific statement as a model‚Äôs output does not agree with the results of an experiment, I would have to say that my statement is disconfirmed (not ‚Äúdisproven‚Äù). If it repeatedly doesn‚Äôt match, that result casts doubt on either the model or the inputs to the model.\n\n\n\nWhen the results of a measurement appears to agree with the model‚Äôs prediction, then we say that the model is confirmed. But not proven.\nThat‚Äôs because no prediction and no measurement is absolutely precise. And so one cannot prove a result, not a model and certainly not a theory. One learns ‚Äì and the scientific community learns ‚Äì a measure of trust for some statements, theories, and models. Some are highly trusted, some less so. We highly trust Einstein‚Äôs Special Relativity, but it‚Äôs not indubitable. See my story of Opera in\nSo, following on that and using the term in its normal way, there is no measureable truth in a scientific process. Scientists will sometimes be loose with language about this‚Ä¶‚Äúgetting near the truth‚Äù or ‚Äù X is probably a part of the truth‚Äù might come out of their mouths, but we all know the limitations."

This is the most general as it allows for a situation in which the initial position is not 0 and in which the initial velocity is not 0. For example, we could be standing on a roof (at a value of \\(x_0\\) that might be 100 feet) and not just drop something, but throw it straight down so that the initial velocity might be 50 mph.\nBut we can derive this from some simple definitions.\nRemember that the average speed is equal to:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n&lt;v&gt; = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{x_f-x_0}{t_f - t_0}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nLet‚Äôs remember what the areas mean for velocity. Suppose we have a constant velocity, then the initial velocity is equal to the final velocity and is obviously equal to the average velocity: \\(v_0=v_f=&lt;v&gt;\\). By rearranging Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:avev}\\):\n\\[\n\\Delta x = &lt;v&gt;\\Delta t \\label{conv}\n\\]\nWe see that this has the form of an area equation, and the figure suggests that the area under a curve of velocity versus time is the distance traveled:\n Constant velocity.\nSo let‚Äôs call \\(A1\\) to be the \\({\\scriptstyle \\enclose{circle}{\\kern .06em 1\\kern .06em}}\\) area in the figure.\n\\[\n\\text{so } A1 = \\text{ base times the height } = (\\Delta t)(&lt;v&gt;)\n\\]\nThis is general: the distance traveled is the area under the curve of the velocity as a function of time."

Here it is:\n On the left: Acceleration for a‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶constant acceleration. On the right: Velocity for a constant acceleration.\nNow what‚Äôs the average velocity? Well, we calculate the area under the ramped velocity curve and divide by the time and that‚Äôs the average velocity as in Equation (eq:avev2). Here it is, using the new area definitions in the figure.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nA = A1 + A2 &= \\dfrac{1}{2}\\text{base times height } + \\text{area of rectangle} \\nonumber \\\\\nA = \\Delta x &= \\dfrac{1}{2}(v_f-v_0)\\Delta t + v_0\\Delta t \\nonumber \\\\\n\\Delta x &= \\Delta t (\\dfrac{1}{2} v_f + v_0 - \\dfrac{1}{2} v_0) = \\Delta t(v_f + v_0) \\nonumber \\\\\n&lt;v&gt; &= \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} = \\dfrac{1}{2}(v_f + v_0)  \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThat‚Äôs interesting. If I‚Äôm 6 feet tall and you‚Äôre 5 feet tall, what‚Äôs the average of our two heights? That‚Äôs simple:\n\\[\n&lt;h&gt; = \\frac{\\text{sum of the heights}}{\\text{the number of heights}}=\\frac{6+5}{2}=5.5\n\\]\nWe‚Äôve just seen that for a constant acceleration (only) the average velocity is just the average of the beginning and ending velocities:\n\\[\n&lt;v&gt; = \\frac{v_y + v_0}{2} \\label{averagev}\n\\]\nDon‚Äôt buy it? Look at this geometrical construction.!\n On the left: the same straight velocity curve (line) for constant acceleration as above. In the middle, remove the upper corner triangle at the midpoint. On the right: Moving things around to replace that triangle in the slot to the left.\nWe started in the left at an initial speed of \\(v_0\\) at \\(t_0\\) and then at constant acceleration, go faster by time \\(t_f\\) to \\(v_f\\). Let‚Äôs calculate the areas differently:\n\nLop off the little notch at the top of the triangle. You can see it is gone in the middle figure, with only a shadow of it remaining. So \\(A1 = A3 + A4\\). So the area is less overall.\nNow restore that \\(A4\\) in the little area to the left of the truncated triangle.\nNow we have a rectangle \\(A5 = A3 + A4\\).\nThe area that we started with is now the same as in the right-hand figure, but it‚Äôs now the sum of the areas of two rectangles:\n\n\\[\nA1 + A2 = (v_? - v_0)\\Delta t + v_0 \\Delta t  \\nonumber\n\\]\nBut what‚Äôs \\(v_?\\)? In order for this construction to work, \\(v_?\\) has to be the midpoint between \\(v_f\\) and \\(v_0\\):\n\\[\nv_? = \\dfrac{v_f - v_0}{2} \\nonumber\n\\]\nSo here we go:\n\\[\nA1 + A2 = \\left(\\frac{v_f-v_0}{2}\\right)\\Delta t + v_0\\Delta t = \\Delta t \\frac{v_f+v_0}{2} \\nonumber\n\\]\nand we get the same result as above:\n\\[\n\\frac{A1 + A2}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{v_f + v_0}{2} = &lt;v&gt;\n\\]\nNow, with this result for the average velocity, we can derive the rest of the equations in the chapter."

    "text": "2 Isaac Newton‚Äôs important idea\nTo start something moving from rest? Apply a force. To speed up or slow down something already moving? Apply a force! To cause something to deviate from a straight line? Yes. Another force. To keep something moving at a constant speed? No (net) force required, thank you.\nHere‚Äôs what he said:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nü´µ Whenever there‚Äôs a change of velocity on any object, a force is at work: since acceleration is a change in velocity, forces are responsible for acceleration. Note: because velocity is technically a vector, then changing direction is also changing velocity.\n\n\nOne of the many ways that Newton got into the textbooks was to argue with Aristotle who insisted that all motion requires a pusher in physical contact: No, Newton said. Constant motion is free. It‚Äôs only accelerated motion that requires payment in the form of the action of a force.\nLet‚Äôs start slowly and sneak up on this idea. Impulsively.\n\n2.1 Impulse ‚Äì Every sport\nIn QS&BB we don‚Äôt need much depth, but we do need three important concepts‚Ä¶the ones that underpinned Newton‚Äôs system: force, mass, and momentum. Let‚Äôs move:\nIn the previous lesson we laid out the rules that govern an object‚Äôs motion.\nNewton: To get something up to speed, you need to whack it or shove it ‚Äî either a sharp collision or a steady push increases the speed of an object. Push harder? More speed. Push longer? Again, more speed.\nSo let‚Äôs codify that everyday notion into a model of forces and motion. Let‚Äôs imagine a force, \\(F\\) that pushes during some time interval, \\(\\Delta t\\). A whack means that \\(\\Delta t\\) is small (like a golf club hitting a ball) while a steady shove (like a rugby scrum) means that the force is slowly applied so \\(\\Delta t\\) is larger.\nHere‚Äôs what we know from experience: applying a force (\\(F\\)) to something for a time interval (\\(\\Delta t\\)) results in the speed increasing in proportion, (\\(\\Delta v\\)). We have the beginnings of a model:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\nF\\Delta t \\propto \\Delta v. \\label{eq:impulse1}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nIncrease \\(F\\), \\(\\Delta t\\), or both on the left-hand side, and the speed goes up on the right-hand side. The quantity on the left side is called the Impulse. It‚Äôs the sports-quantity. Any game involving a ball involves impulse and exceptional athletes can control both the \\(F\\) and the \\(\\Delta t\\). The quantity on the right implies that the speed changed and of course if the speed changed, then the object accelerated and/or it changed direction.\nWe need to refine the model. But first some units and language:\n\nMay the force be with you by so many different names We will use forces many times in QS&BB, which is a common quantity in our lives because of ‚Äúweight.‚Äù But if you‚Äôre from the United States, when you step on the bathroom scale it reports back to you your weight in the Imperial measurement system (or ‚Äúcustomary measures system‚Äù) as too many Pounds, lbs. In a minute, you‚Äôll see why that‚Äôs confusing when comparing to the rest of the world where the bathroom scale would report kilograms.  The unit of force in the International System of Units (SI), which includes the older ‚Äúmetric system‚Äù or MKS (Meter, Kilogram, Second) is the Newton, N. If you go to the gas station in Berlin, you‚Äôll fill your tires to a pressure measured in Pascals, which is Newtons per square meter. Of course up the street from me, our Michigan gas station reports pounds per square inch for my pressure.\n\nWe‚Äôll predominantly use the unit of Newton as the modern measure of a force ‚Äì like the rest of the civilized world. I‚Äôll not obsess with units and so I‚Äôm happy for you to rely on Mr.¬†Google in almost all instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nüîê Type this into your browser: ‚Äúconvert 10 pounds into newtons‚Äù and you‚Äôll be rewarded with the answer and a tool for all kinds of unit conversions. You‚Äôre welcome.\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Inertia\nPressing forward (see what I did there?). Let‚Äôs think about pushing.\nSuppose I apply a force of \\(F=100\\) pounds for 60 seconds to a Volkswagen and you apply a force of \\(F=100\\) pounds for 60 seconds to a little red wagon. We both begin our efforts at point A:\n\n\nCode\n# #| out.width: ‚Äú700px‚Äù  \n# #| column: screen\n#| echo: false\nknitr::include_graphics(\"./iwagon.png\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: The same force applied to two red objects, of very different sizes\n\n\n\n\n\nWill the resulting \\(\\Delta v\\) at point B be the same for both vehicles?\nOf course not. The little red wagon will gain more speed than the Volkswagen (regardless of its color). The VW is more reluctant to be accelerated than the wagon. So Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:impulse1}\\) is not the whole story. What‚Äôs missing is just that reluctance that any object has to being accelerated, which has a name: inertia."

The right-hand version where you have a fixed goal ‚Äì like stopping precisely ‚Äì fits football, gymnastics, and track and field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, repeat after me:\n\nIf there is no net force on an object\n\nit‚Äôs motion doesn‚Äôt change\nüëâ if its speed was zero‚Ä¶it stays zero\nüëâ if its speed was 55 mph‚Ä¶it stays at 55 mph\n\n\nSaid another way, if you see the motion of any object changing‚Ä¶ then somewhere there is a force actiing (it might be invisible, like a magnetic field).\nOne quick change of Equation \\(\\eqref{momentumdef}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nF\\Delta t &= \\Delta p \\nonumber \\\\\nF &= \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t} \\label{newtons2} \\\\\n\\text{since }&=\\Delta p = \\Delta (mv) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{and if the mass is constant } &= \\Delta p =m\\Delta v \\nonumber\\\\\nF &= m \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{and since } &= \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t} = a \\nonumber \\\\\nF &= ma \\label{newtons2b}\n\\end{align}\n\\] A couple of these are suitable for a T-shirt: Equation \\(\\eqref{newtons2}\\) is ‚ÄúNewton‚Äôs Second law of Motion‚Äù in its most general physics-major form. Equation \\(\\eqref{newtons2b}\\) is the T-shirt version for motion in which the mass of an object undergoing a push doesn‚Äôt change.\n\n4.1 Newton‚Äôs 3 laws of motion\nIf there‚Äôs a second law, there must be a first one and there is‚Ä¶and a third one. Here they are for completeness:\n\nAn object with constant velociy will retain that constant velocity of zero or another value.\nBest expressed as an equation as \\(\\eqref{newtons2}\\).\nFor every force that object A applies to object B, an equal and opposite force will be appled by B to A.\n\nThe Third law is very useful for solving problems, but that‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre about in QS&BB.\n\n\n4.2 Weight\nThere‚Äôs an important special case of Equation \\(\\eqref{newtons2b}\\) which has to do with the earth and, well, everything that‚Äôs not nailed down. The earth attracts all objects with a force (which we‚Äôll talk about in a bit) that seems constant and has a partcular value of acceleration, that of gravity., We affectionately call it \\(g\\). So your weight is the force that the earth applies to you and so we simply have: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nF &= ma \\text{ ...now modify for gravitational force}\\nonumber \\\\\nF &= W \\text{ for the special force called \"weight\"} \\nonumber \\\\\na &= g \\text{ for the special acceleration of gravity} \\nonumber\\\\\nW &=mg \\text{ which is weight on earth} \\label{weight}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Two caveats:\n\nWe call this \\(g\\) ‚Äúlittle g‚Äù and it‚Äôs only got a specific value for the earth. There are different little g‚Äôs for other planets, moons, or stars.\nThe force of gravity is actually not constant ‚Äì stay tuned. But miles above tthe earth it‚Äôs still so close to \\(g\\) that we often pretend that it‚Äôs constant.\n\nSo little g is an important number:\n\nIn the american system, \\(g = 32\\) feet/second\\(^2\\) , 32 ft/s\\(^2\\)\nFor the rest of the world, \\(g = 9.8\\) meters/second\\(^2\\), 9.8 m/s$2"

    "text": "5 Circular Motion\nRemember that if a velocity changes, then there‚Äôs an force acting as a cause and an acceleration is the result. Well, what about driving around a curve keeping your accelerator at 50 mph? This is the one time in QS&BB we‚Äôll care about the vector nature of velocity. A true (for a professional physicist or student) velocity has a magnitude (what your speedometer reads back) and a direction. So going 50 mph north is a different velocity than going 50 mph east. Same speed, different velocity.\nOkay, what‚Äôs going on with you turning that corner where your direction changes but your speed doesn‚Äôt. From the formal definition, the velocity must change üëâ so there must be a force acting üëâ so there is an acceleration.\nIt might be easier to think of twirling something overhead. Suppose you tie a ball to a thin rope and get it rotating above your head in a horizontal plane, like our little guy in the margin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: Twirling a ball over your head in a horizontal plane.\n\n\n\nYou can feel a tug. That is, the ball seems to exert a force on your hand through the rope. But what‚Äôs really going on is that the ball wants to go forward (Newton‚Äôs first law) and you pull it back incrementally, bit by bit as it goes around. You‚Äôre supplying that force necessary to defeat its straight line motion.\nThis force-towards-the-center is called ‚Äúcentripetal force‚Äù ‚Äì you‚Äôve maybe heard of ‚Äúcentrifugal force‚Äù but that‚Äôs different and sometimes called ‚Äúficticious‚Äù which seems sort of insulting. But when you‚Äôre a passenger in a car that‚Äôs going around a curve, you feel a force that‚Äôs away from the center of the curve‚Ä¶that‚Äôs centifugal. But that‚Äôs just your body trying to obey that first law and go straight, while you‚Äôre in this car going, well, not straight. Where do you get the force that makes you follow the car? The door against your shoulder, the friction of the back of your lap on the seat, and hopefully your seatbelt. Absent those forces which pull you toward the center of the curve, you‚Äôd go flying.\nThe acceleration that you (or the ball) experience is toward the center of the circle (which we‚Äôll say has radius \\(R\\), following the direction of the force, and has its own formula and name of ‚Äúcentripetal acceleration‚Äù (\\(a_c\\)): \\[\na_c=\\frac{v^2}{R} \\label{centripetala}\n\\] From Newton‚Äôs second law, there‚Äôs then a centripetal force. That tug you provide to the ball of mass \\(m\\) is: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nF_c &= m a_c \\nonumber \\\\\nF_c &=m \\frac{v^2}{R} \\label{centripetalf}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n‚Üê Previous: 1.00 motion | Next: 3.00 collisions"

I earned my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Iowa State University in 1972. After a year in industry, I returned to academia, completing an M.S. in Physics and the Philosophy of Science at Northern Illinois University and a Ph.D.¬†in Physics at Carnegie-Mellon University in 1980. Following two years as a postdoctoral researcher at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, I joined the MSU Department of Physics and Astronomy in 1982, and in 2011, I was honored as a University Distinguished Professor.\nAs Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy from 1994 to 2001, I oversaw the construction of a new department building, facilitated MSU‚Äôs involvement in the construction of the SOAR 4m telescope in Chile, and integrated the private Abrams Planetarium into the department. After stepping down as Chair in 2001, I returned to full-time research and teaching in particle physics.\nIn the 1980s, I served as spokesperson for Fermilab‚Äôs neutrino experiment E733 and have been a member of the Fermilab D0 collaboration since its early days. I‚Äôve taken on leadership roles in significant measurements and the development of D0 apparatus components, including chairing the experiment‚Äôs Computing Policy Board and assembling an early grid Linux farm that generated 1 billion Monte Carlo events in the late 1990s.\nI am also a member of MSU‚Äôs LHC ATLAS group, where I was the first convenor of the Single Top Group and led the ‚ÄúPhase 0‚Äù ‚ÄúCMX‚Äù trigger electronics upgrade for the L1Calo system. Together with a colleague from the University of Michigan, I conceived and continue to direct the ATLAS ‚ÄúTier 2‚Äù data center, funded through competitive awards.\nIn 2010, I served as Chair of the APS Division of Particles and Fields. Over the years, I‚Äôve been a member of the DOE High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP), the United States representative to the International Committee on Future Accelerators (ICFA), and served two terms on the Fermilab Physics Advisory Committee. I‚Äôve also been a member of the Fermilab Research Alliance Board of Directors, the United States ATLAS Institutional Board Chair for two years, and co-convened the DPF Snowmass 2013 Energy Frontier study, which covered all aspects of particle physics.\nThroughout my career, I‚Äôve taught across the undergraduate and graduate curricula, and in recent years, I‚Äôve focused on teaching general education students. I developed two unique courses for non-science majors: one that intertwines the history of physics with the history of art and another exploring elementary particle physics and cosmology.\nI‚Äôve authored or co-authored over 1,000 publications in experimental and phenomenological particle physics and have been continuously funded by the National Science Foundation since 1982. I‚Äôm a Fellow of the American Physical Society and have received two all-university awards from MSU for research and teaching.\nOutside of physics, I‚Äôm a lifelong baseball fan and have spent many years coaching high school baseball in East Lansing.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Just how science works can be tricky and everyone has an opinion. The Nature of Science (NOS) is its own discpline across philosophy, history, sociology, and science itself. While we physicists have a pretty good sense of what constitutes good science, we don‚Äôt have a rulebook and we can sometimes argue about this among ourselves.\nThere‚Äôs an element of ‚Äúif it works, it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù But also some taboos.\nSince I‚Äôll be talking about old and new ideas, I thought I should try to put down my views on NOS from my physics-perspective. Below is a sketch to be fleshed out in separate posts with links below.\n\n\nI think that the term scientific ‚ÄúLaw‚Äù is misleading because it implies a fancy üéì permanence and universality, running counter to the fact that science is contingent. It originated with Isaac Newton‚Äôs deciphering of what appeared to be the absolute rules of the Universe. His explanations convinced people that the world was knowable ‚Äì¬†no small part of the basis of the Enlightenment. So science revealed Laws, capital ‚ÄúL.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mystic William Blake, painted his Newton (1795‚Äìc.1805, William Blake) as a negative image. Blake was distinctly unhappy with what he thought was a sterile and godless turn in European thought. But that he chose this subject as a vehicle for his annimosity toward the Enlightenment is‚Ä¶, well, enlightening.\n\n\nBut we don‚Äôt do Law any more. We do theories and models ‚Äì at least I do üòé. That‚Äôs because the distinction between a Law of physics and a theory of physics is often often misunderstood. (See in the menu bar ‚òùÔ∏è my gripe in just a theory? .) For now, if I mention an old-historical ‚Äúlaw‚Äù (‚ÄúNewton‚Äôs law‚Äù) I‚Äôll use lower case. Otherwise, it‚Äôs theories‚Ä¶all the way down.\n\n\n\nI think that the common idea about a theory is that it is a set of guesses or hunches. We all do it: have a theory as to why that tree fell down (‚ÄúIt was leaning and it was really windy.‚Äù)\nThis everyday sense leads to the a mistaken notion that theories are somehow less than laws. Since I‚Äôve aleready set aside ‚Äúlaws‚Äù as unhelpful, let me try to explain what my notion of theories are.\nA scientific theory is a framework that can have three jobs:\n\nExplain observed phenomena.\nTie together ideas that once seemed unrelated.\nPredict new phenomena ‚Äì while being consistent with previously successes. (Ask Mr Google about Immanuel Velikovsky and Venus.)\n\nWe usually emphasize #3, but I think that #1 is underappreciated. Can an acceptable theory only explain even if it doesn‚Äôt yet predict novel phenomena? (See ‚Äúarguing among ourselves‚Äù in the first paragraph.)\nTextbooks often define a scientific theory as a systematic explanation facts. But what counts as an explanation? A paragraph? A logical set of proofs? A set of mathematical equations? A nicely formed tweet?\nMy problem is distinguishing something as all encompassing as Quantum Theory from the theory of atoms. The latter is a part of the former since we describe atoms using the tools and commitments of Quantum Theory.\nHere‚Äôs my take:\nA framework ‚Äì made of logical statements and/or mathematics ‚Äì provides tools and guidance on how to use them. Furthermore ‚Äì and this is important ‚Äì a theory limits itself to a domain: For example, A theory of chemical bonding doesn‚Äôt need to encompass the theory of black holes. Its ‚Äúdomain‚Äù is atoms and molecules. Engineers bulding bridges use Newton‚Äôs (‚Äúlaws of‚Äù we say) mechanics, but their domain doesn‚Äôt encompass the theory of evolution. But there are overlaps: the theory of chemical bonding must embrace the rules of the quantum theory, so there is a heirarchy among theories.\nTwo important aspects of this complicated mix.\n\nOur trust in theories is earned. Quantum mechanics is highly trusted (not sacred, so not Law-like) It might be a part of a grander theory.\nWe can‚Äôt use or test a theory directly. Einstein‚Äôs Special Theory of Relativity consists of two short English (well, German) sentences in the form of postuates. That‚Äôs the framework idea. Testing and using them requires building models..\n\nWe‚Äôre guided bytheories, but we test models. In physics, those models are mathematical.\n\n\n\nWhen we make mathematical [model]s, they are very specific. First they consist of inputs, Let‚Äôs call them (x, y, z), where the variables could be numerical facts or procedural commitments or other inputs. Then, a model has some calculational, ‚úèÔ∏è , process. An algorithm if you will that tests an idea. Maybe you remember ‚Äúturning the crank‚Äù in a school cacluation.\nThat model has an‚Ä¶urgency. Start it going (calculating) and a conclusion, üìà , is the result. So in cartoon form:\n‚Äù [(x, y, z) ‚Üí ‚úèÔ∏è ] will result in: üìà .‚Äù\nWhat comes out after ‚Äúturning the crank‚Äù is üìà: a function, a number, a plot, an expected state of matter. This a theory cannot do.\nThe result, üìà, can refer to something previously known (an explanation) or to something to be tested (a prediction). The whole process, [model + successful explanation] or [model + prediction + successful measurement] I‚Äôll call a scientific process.\n\n\n\nScientific knowledge is a bit special. It‚Äôs easy for us in everyday life to spontaneously decide that we ‚Äúknow‚Äù something ‚Äì¬†until we learn that we were were wrong! And that‚Äôs not a problem, it happens.\nBut scientific knowledge is different and we expect a lot from it. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äôbelief‚Äù which is personal and often unjustifiable. In fact, while it sounds scientific, ‚ÄúI believe in evolution‚Äù is not a scientific statement. Just like ‚ÄúI believe in martians‚Äù isn‚Äôt. Belief is not justified in scientific language.\nOne of the jobs of a scientific statement is to assert something that‚Äôs checkable. It must be public, based on expertise, always open to scrutiny, and within the norms of the scientific community (admitedly, a tough thing to define). What‚Äôs important is that scientific statements are made and trusted by experts. Unfortunately, folks with expertise are sometimes now called ‚Äúelites,‚Äù as if expertise is bad.\nScientific statements are the grammar used to test the claims of models against experiment. They can take the form of sentences, a mathematical function, the prediction of a state of matter, or a numerical fact. Interpreting them can, however, be nuanced.\nIf my scientific statement ( üìà ) does not agree with the results of an experiment, I would have to say that my statement is disconfirmed (not ‚Äúdisproven‚Äù). If it repeatedly doesn‚Äôt match, that result casts doubt on the model but more likely on the inputs to the model.\n\n\nWhen the results of a measurement appears to agree with the model‚Äôs prediction, then we say that the model is confirmed. But that‚Äôs nuanced in a variety of ways.\n\nFirst, the domain may be so broad as to be unhelpful as a scientific statement. That Winston-Salem is between Detroit and Miami could be confirmed but it‚Äôs not very precise.\nSecond, it‚Äôs possible for a scientific statement to agree with experiment, but accidentally. When I say it‚Äôs 2 pm and it is 2 pm, but my watch stopped at 2 am, that‚Äôs not a helpful scientific conclusion. Justification is required of a confirmed scientific statement.\nFinally, and this is both important and not understood outside of the scientifi community is uncertainty. If the results of a political poll say that candidate X polls at 49% and candidate Y polls at 51% and that the margin of uncertainty is 5%, then those candidates are tied. Y is not ahead of X. In political polling these are statements about the statistical precision of the measurement, but in scientific prediction and measurement there are other uncertainties in play. The inputs (x, y, z) are certainly imprecise and that uncertainty will be carried through to the results of the model. And, the model‚Äôs algorithm might have its own uncertainties. The end result is that if I were to say that my scientific statement is 2 feet, that‚Äôs not scientific. If you used a yardstick without any markings to make your measurement, then your ability to be as precise as one foot is nil. If you used a micrometer to make your measurement, then your determination of ‚Äú2‚Äù might be very precise, but it would still have uncertainty. The scientifically proper way to report the model‚Äôs prediction and/or the experiment‚Äôs result is \\(2\\pm a\\) feet where \\(a\\) is the uncertainty, like \\(2 \\pm 0.1\\) feet.\n\nThis means that no prediction and no measurement is absolutely precise. And so one cannot prove a result, not a model and certainly not a theory. So, following on that and using the term in its normal way, there is no measureable truth in a scientific process."

    "text": "Scientific knowledge is a bit special. It‚Äôs easy for us in everyday life to spontaneously decide that we ‚Äúknow‚Äù something ‚Äì¬†until we learn that we were were wrong! And that‚Äôs not a problem, it happens.\nBut scientific knowledge is different and we expect a lot from it. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äôbelief‚Äù which is personal and often unjustifiable. In fact, while it sounds scientific, ‚ÄúI believe in evolution‚Äù is not a scientific statement. Just like ‚ÄúI believe in martians‚Äù isn‚Äôt. Belief is not justified in scientific language.\nOne of the jobs of a scientific statement is to assert something that‚Äôs checkable. It must be public, based on expertise, always open to scrutiny, and within the norms of the scientific community (admitedly, a tough thing to define). What‚Äôs important is that scientific statements are made and trusted by experts. Unfortunately, folks with expertise are sometimes now called ‚Äúelites,‚Äù as if expertise is bad.\nScientific statements are the grammar used to test the claims of models against experiment. They can take the form of sentences, a mathematical function, the prediction of a state of matter, or a numerical fact. Interpreting them can, however, be nuanced.\nIf my scientific statement ( üìà ) does not agree with the results of an experiment, I would have to say that my statement is disconfirmed (not ‚Äúdisproven‚Äù). If it repeatedly doesn‚Äôt match, that result casts doubt on the model but more likely on the inputs to the model.\n\n\nWhen the results of a measurement appears to agree with the model‚Äôs prediction, then we say that the model is confirmed. But that‚Äôs nuanced in a variety of ways.\n\nFirst, the domain may be so broad as to be unhelpful as a scientific statement. That Winston-Salem is between Detroit and Miami could be confirmed but it‚Äôs not very precise.\nSecond, it‚Äôs possible for a scientific statement to agree with experiment, but accidentally. When I say it‚Äôs 2 pm and it is 2 pm, but my watch stopped at 2 am, that‚Äôs not a helpful scientific conclusion. Justification is required of a confirmed scientific statement.\nFinally, and this is both important and not understood outside of the scientifi community is uncertainty. If the results of a political poll say that candidate X polls at 49% and candidate Y polls at 51% and that the margin of uncertainty is 5%, then those candidates are tied. Y is not ahead of X. In political polling these are statements about the statistical precision of the measurement, but in scientific prediction and measurement there are other uncertainties in play. The inputs (x, y, z) are certainly imprecise and that uncertainty will be carried through to the results of the model. And, the model‚Äôs algorithm might have its own uncertainties. The end result is that if I were to say that my scientific statement is 2 feet, that‚Äôs not scientific. If you used a yardstick without any markings to make your measurement, then your ability to be as precise as one foot is nil. If you used a micrometer to make your measurement, then your determination of ‚Äú2‚Äù might be very precise, but it would still have uncertainty. The scientifically proper way to report the model‚Äôs prediction and/or the experiment‚Äôs result is \\(2\\pm a\\) feet where \\(a\\) is the uncertainty, like \\(2 \\pm 0.1\\) feet.\n\nThis means that no prediction and no measurement is absolutely precise. And so one cannot prove a result, not a model and certainly not a theory. So, following on that and using the term in its normal way, there is no measureable truth in a scientific process."

Laws are forever!\nSo we don‚Äôt do Law any more. We do theories and models ‚Äì at least I do üòé. That‚Äôs because the distinction between a Law of physics and a theory of physics is often often misunderstood. (See in the menu bar ‚òùÔ∏è my gripe in just a theory? .)\n\n1.1 Theories\nI think that the common idea about a theory is that it is a set of guesses or hunches. We all do it: have a theory as to why that tree fell down (‚ÄúIt was leaning and it was really windy.‚Äù)\nThis everyday-sense leads to the a mistaken notion that theories are somehow less than laws. Since I‚Äôve aleready set aside ‚Äúlaws‚Äù as unhelpful, let me try to explain what my notion of theories are.\nA scientific theory is a framework that can have three jobs:\n\nExplain observed phenomena.\nTie together ideas that once seemed unrelated.\nPredict new phenomena ‚Äì while being consistent with previously successes.

It‚Äôs easy for us in everyday life to spontaneously decide that we ‚Äúknow‚Äù something ‚Äì¬†until we learn that we were were wrong! And that‚Äôs not a problem, it happens.\nBut scientific knowledge is different and we expect a lot from it. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äôbelief‚Äù which is personal and often unjustifiable. In fact, while it sounds scientific, ‚ÄúI believe in evolution‚Äù is not a scientific statement. Belief is not justifiable in scientific language.\nThe grammar of scientific knowledge is scientific statements.\n\n3.1 Scientific statements\nA scientific statement is not casual talk. It‚Äôs an assertion of something that‚Äôs checkable and it‚Äôs either what a model generates or how a scientific process is later described for the public. In both cases it‚Äôs open to scrutiny, and speaks a language that is within the norms of the scientific community (admitedly, a tough thing to define).\nWhatever comes out of a model‚Äôs crank-turning is a scientific statement in a form that can be compared with an experiment: they can be sentences, a mathematical function, the prediction of a state of matter, or a numerical fact.\nThat‚Äôs sort of an active job, but it can also do the work of reporting on results and there it has similar requirements. To say that ‚ÄúThe value of the Newtonian constant of gravitation is \\(6.674 30 \\times 10^{-11}\\) m\\(^3\\) kg\\(^{-1}\\) s\\(^{-2}\\).‚Äù is not a scientfic statement. Rather, The value of the Newtonian constant of gravitation is \\(6.674 30 \\times 10^{-11} \\pm 0.00015\\) m\\(^3\\) kg\\(^{-1}\\) s\\(^{-2}\\).‚Äù is a scientific statement. You see, higher standards.\nIf my scientific statement as a model‚Äôs output does not agree with the results of an experiment, I would have to say that my statement is disconfirmed (not ‚Äúdisproven‚Äù). If it repeatedly doesn‚Äôt match, that result casts doubt on either the model or the inputs to the model.\n\n\n3.2 Proof?\nWhen the results of a measurement appears to agree with the model‚Äôs prediction, then we say that the model is confirmed. But not proven.\nThat‚Äôs because no prediction and no measurement is absolutely precise. And so one cannot prove a result, not a model and certainly not a theory. One learns ‚Äì and the scientific community learns ‚Äì a measure of trust for some statements, theories, and models. Some are highly trusted, some less so. We highly trust Einstein‚Äôs Special Relativity, but it‚Äôs not indubitable. See my story of Opera in\nSo, following on that and using the term in its normal way, there is no measureable truth in a scientific process. Scientists will sometimes be loose with language about this‚Ä¶‚Äúgetting near the truth‚Äù or ‚Äù X is probably a part of the truth‚Äù might come out of their mouths, but we all know the limitations.\nHere‚Äôs more detail: 3.00 knowledge, proof, and truth"
