But, it might be more fullfilling to have some background in some basic physics concepts like force, momentum, energy, gravity…and so on.\nSo for those of you who maybe had physics a long time ago, or never, …I’ve created some bare-bones tutorial content. How these and other tutorials differ from the “regular” posts is that they’re organized start to finish in a logically sequential format like you expect from a (tiny) textbook. Of course, you can also jump in anywhere for a targeted refresher.\nSo two kinds of posts in QS&BB:"

This list is intentionally sparse with links inside to “just the facts” to get you going or fill in some gaps with minimal, or in some cases, no mathematics:\n\nmotion\nmomentum and force\ncollisions\nenergy\nGalilean astronomy and the gravitational rules from Newton\nElectrostatics and magnetism, almost no mathematics\nFaraday’s experiments, again, almost no formulae\nFaraday’s fields, essentially no mathematicss\nWaves and Maxwell’s fields, essentially no mathematics\nSpecial Relativity, an introduction to the problem Einstein tackled\nSpecial Relativity, his postulates and some formulae\nSpecial Relativity, the transformations using graphs, not mathematics\nSpecial Relativity, Spacetime and yes, a formula: \\(E=mc^2\\)\n\n\n\n1.2 Feynman Diagrams\nThis tutorial shows how with a mimimum of rules you can draw your own diagrams for any particle physics reaction and with a little bit of background, appreciate when I use Feynman Diagrams in my stories. Antimatter is involved.\nI’ve created a separate, “off-site” electronic book for this tutorial.\n\n\n1.3 Some Math\nI’ve provided a minimal sketch of the math that might be a refresher for you: Powers of 10. The simplest algebra. That’s it.\nIf I need a complicated formula? I’ll draw a graph, sometimes with interactively adjustable parameters to explore the physics. A complicated formula is always a graph."

    "text": "I’m a “University Distinguished Professor” in the Physics and Astronomy Department at MSU, and on the MSU faculty since 1982. These days, I also serve as an Adjunct Professor of Physics at Arizona State University.\nMy bachelor’s degree is in Electrical Engineering from Iowa State University, but I switched gears after working in private industry for a short while. I went on to earn an MS in Physics and Philosophy of Science from Northern Illinois University and then completed my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University, focusing on both theoretical and experimental elementary particle physics. I spent a couple of years as a postdoctoral researcher at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and joined the MSU faculty in 1982.\nLike many scientists, I owe my inspiration to a great high school science teacher. For me, that was Walter Hauswald at Sycamore, Illinois High School. He let me help with class prep and encouraged me to explore topics like quantum mechanics outside of class. I was lucky to have him for all three years of my high school physical science courses: I dedicated my Ph.D. thesis to him.\nMy family is important to me. Janet and I have been married for more than 50 years and immensely enjoy our two grown kids and grandtwins.\n\nBTW. All my life I’ve been “Chip,” although my driver’s license and passport say “Raymond.” Before you ask, nobody claims to know where this started. Please note before being really proud of yourself: “Chip off the old Brock” is not new, it’s not funny anymore, and all of you think you were the first to invent it.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "How science works can be tricky and everyone has an opinion. The Nature of Science (NOS) is its own discpline across philosophy, history, sociology, and science itself.\nSince I’ll be talking about old and new ideas, I thought I should try to put down my views on NOS from my physics-perspective. Below is a sketch to be fleshed out in separate posts with links below.\n\n\nI think that the term scientific “Law” is misleading because it implies a fancy 🎓 permanence and universality, running counter to the fact that science is contingent – Laws are subject to change, and that’s not the picture that many people have. Laws are forever!\nSo we don’t do Law any more. We do theories and models – at least I do 😎. That’s because the distinction between a Law of physics and a theory of physics is often often misunderstood. (See in the menu bar ☝️ my gripe in just a theory? .)\n\n\nI think that the common idea about a theory is that it is a set of guesses or hunches. We all do it: have a theory as to why that tree fell down (“It was leaning and it was really windy.”)\nThis everyday-sense leads to the a mistaken notion that theories are somehow less than laws. Since I’ve aleready set aside “laws” as unhelpful, let me try to explain what my notion of theories are.\nA scientific theory is a framework that can have three jobs:\n\nExplain observed phenomena.\nTie together ideas that once seemed unrelated.\nPredict new phenomena – while being consistent with previously successes. (Ask Mr Google about Immanuel Velikovsky and Venus.)\n\nWe’re guided by theories, but we test mathematical models.\nHere’s more with some examples: 1.00 laws\n\n\n\n\nWhen we make mathematical models, they are very specific. They consist of inputs and some calculational process – an algorithm if you will, that tests an idea. Maybe you remember “turning the crank” in a school calculation.\nWhat comes out after “turning the crank” is a function, a number, a plot, an expected state of matter in the form of a scientific statement. This, a theory cannot do. The result can refer to something previously known (an explanation) or to something to be tested (a prediction).\nHere’s more detail: 5.00 models and scientific statements\n\n\n\nScientific knowledge is a bit special. It’s easy for us in everyday life to spontaneously decide that we “know” something – until we learn that we were were wrong! And that’s not a problem, it happens.\nBut scientific knowledge is different and we expect a lot from it. It’s not a ’belief” which is personal and often unjustifiable. In fact, while it sounds scientific, “I believe in evolution” is not a scientific statement. Belief is not justifiable in scientific language.\nThe grammar of scientific knowledge is scientific statements.\n\n\nA scientific statement is not casual talk. It’s an assertion of something that’s checkable and it’s either what a model generates or how a scientific process is later described for the public. In both cases it’s open to scrutiny, and speaks a language that is within the norms of the scientific community (admitedly, a tough thing to define).\nWhatever comes out of a model’s crank-turning is a scientific statement in a form that can be compared with an experiment: they can be sentences, a mathematical function, the prediction of a state of matter, or a numerical fact.\nThat’s sort of an active job, but it can also do the work of reporting on results and there it has similar requirements. To say that “The value of the Newtonian constant of gravitation is \\(6.674 30 \\times 10^{-11}\\) m\\(^3\\) kg\\(^{-1}\\) s\\(^{-2}\\).” is not a scientfic statement. Rather, The value of the Newtonian constant of gravitation is \\(6.674 30 \\times 10^{-11} \\pm 0.00015\\) m\\(^3\\) kg\\(^{-1}\\) s\\(^{-2}\\).” is a scientific statement. You see, higher standards.\nIf my scientific statement as a model’s output does not agree with the results of an experiment, I would have to say that my statement is disconfirmed (not “disproven”). If it repeatedly doesn’t match, that result casts doubt on either the model or the inputs to the model.\n\n\n\nWhen the results of a measurement appears to agree with the model’s prediction, then we say that the model is confirmed. But not proven.\nThat’s because no prediction and no measurement is absolutely precise. And so one cannot prove a result, not a model and certainly not a theory. One learns – and the scientific community learns – a measure of trust for some statements, theories, and models. Some are highly trusted, some less so. We highly trust Einstein’s Special Relativity, but it’s not indubitable. See my story of Opera in\nSo, following on that and using the term in its normal way, there is no measureable truth in a scientific process. Scientists will sometimes be loose with language about this…“getting near the truth” or ” X is probably a part of the truth” might come out of their mouths, but we all know the limitations."

Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy\n\nWe’re about to follow two big stories which are chapters in the biggest story of all: the “just so” tale of the beginning of the universe. Yes, that one. Everything. The plot of this story has all sorts of twists and turns that we’re still unraveling. Surprises await.\nOf course, the details are where the devil lives and they are fiercely complex. So much so that two entirely different scientific communities are currently deployed to battle with nature, who likes to keep secrets: those of us who work on the “outside” and those who explore the “inside.” The outside crew are astronomers and astrophysicists. They measure and characterize the constituents and nature of the cosmos. They look out. The inside teams mimic the earliest picoseconds of the universe by recreating its incredibly hot, adolescent conditions in laboratories here on the Earth. These are the particle physicists and they look in. I’m one of those. QS&BB is the story of both."

    "section": "2 What’s the smallest thing we can know about?",
    "text": "2 What’s the smallest thing we can know about?\n\n2.1 The inside for my grandparents.\nFor people of my grandparents’ generation, the sophisticated answer would be “what you can see.” I was born in the year 1950, and so my grandparents were children at the dawn of the 20th century which is when physics got interesting. They would have been taught that if you can’t see it, then it can’t be real. To claim otherwise would be absurd. Chemists spoke of atoms, but were disdainful of anyone who thought they were real. They were just a shorthand picture for how to visualize elements. Physicists were even less flexible.\n\n\n2.2 The inside for my parents.\nFor people of my parents’ generation, the answer would have been “protons, neutrons, and electrons.” The atom had been thrust into believability around the turn of the century, and then refined during the next two decades. But the neat planet-like picture of the atom was where it all stopped for many.\n\n\n2.3 The inside …for us!\nIn our generation, the answer to the “smallest” question has been “quarks and leptons” …but we fully expect that they are not the end of the “smallest” story. We’re hard at work, even as we speak with brand new tools to explore further than ever before.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a computer reconstruction of the collision of two protons at the Large Hadron Collider. The ATLAS experiment is one of two gargantian ‘detectors’ that catches the debris from these energetic collisions. The figure shows how two quarks in each of the colliding protons bounce off from one another and emerge in two collimated ‘jets’ of debris as they rip through the detector. The view is from the side and the lengths of these jets is each about 30 feet long. The length that the colliding quarks probed is about 0.000000000000000018 meters. This is today’s answer to the ‘how small’ question.\n\n\n\nMaybe in your generation? The sky’s the limit! We’ve hints at solving some old puzzles and we’ll undoubtedly find new ones. We’re developing and deploying amazing new instruments and theoretical ideas now rub shoulders with not just nature, but philosophy and the deepest questions asked by humans. Your generation is going to see amazing things.\nThrough decades of intense experimentation and imaginative theorizing, the tiniest bits of reality are turning out to be a fascinating collection of objects. In the 1950s and 1960s, we just stood back and tried to catch the hundreds of particles that our experiments spit out at us. New particles every year! Names that nobody could remember. Hundreds of them, which was ludicrous! Didn’t nature have some plan?\n\n“Quarks”? “Leptons”? Lots of jargon and I’ll keep it all straight for you as we go along.For now, quarks are itsy-bitsy pieces of the proton and leptons include the electron and others. New states of matter might be: “additional quarks, the Higgs Boson, Supersymmetric Particles, Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), Dark Matter particles…” all famous candidates for future discovery. Of course whenever we get too cocky, nature plots to surprise us with something completely unexpected—more often than we’d like to admit! So, we’re instinctively wary of being too sure of what’s coming.\n\nThe good news is that we’ve uncovered a model that’s a very good picture of how much of the fundamental particles of the universe work together and we’ve been exploring it since the 1970s. We’ve knitted that earlier mess together into a coherent picture of the entities themselves as well as the rules that govern how that stuff behaves. But we’re unhappy. Our grand synthesis of the Tiniest Bits Story—called the Standard Model — needs some polishing. Or more. While it’s been the gold-standard of the successful scientific theory, we expect that new tiny bits are lurking in our experiments and we will be astonished if nothing shows up as we dig deeper. This new anticipation would have been met with blank stares only a couple of decades ago.\nSo much for the inside effort."

So what’s the biggest real thing you can know about?\n\n3.1 The outside for my grandparents.\nFor people of my grandparents’ generation the learned answer to this question would be “the size of the Milky Way,” which they would have been taught constituted the whole universe. Everything visible in the night sky was thought to be a part of one big, but still cozy cluster of stars which we see to be densest around the southern sky (from North America). Not only was my grandparents’ universe compact, it was supposed to be permanent—static and unchanging— built of three kinds of objects: planets, stars, and clusters of stars. Stars twinkled, planets were steadfastly bright, and clusters of stars were fuzzy, indicative of their presumed distances from us. Sure, they all moved with regularity during each night and shifted slightly in a year, but the large scale structure of my grandparents’ universe was simple: a nice, intimate, dependable universe.\n\n\n3.2 The outside for my parents.\nFor people of my parents’ generation, the universe suddenly became huge. Those fuzzy clusters were found to be other galaxies outside of the Milky Way which are surprisingly far from us—we’re not alone in our comfy galaxy. They were taught about thousands—we now know, billions—of others, of which the Milky Way is a relatively modest and ordinary example.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, a compilation of hundreds of days of observation of a single dime-sized patch on the sky in the constellation, Fornax. Every spot is a galaxy, some nearby and some at the edge of our ability to see.\n\n\n\nThis is the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, a compilation of hundreds of days of observation of a single dime-sized patch on the sky in the constellation, Fornax. Every spot is a galaxy, some nearby and some at the edge of our ability to see. ```\nIn this remarkable galactic family photograph the youngest galaxy imaged is 13.2 billion years old. We see it as it was when its light left its surface, on the way to the Hubble’s camera. It’s also a time when the universe was much smaller than it is now. This picture is today’s answer to the “biggest thing” question.\n\n\n3.3 The outside for us.\nBut, the real shocker was the overthrow of the static universe of my grandparents era. My parents’ universe was found to be flying apart—expanding—at a breakneck speed. No longer a tight-knit, stable thing…the universe is now huge and reckless. The really unsettling piece of news for my generation is that the Big Questions of antiquity are now legitimate scientific research programs: Was there a beginning to the universe? Are we alone? Will the universe end? Are there other universes? Was there anything before The Beginning? What drives the expansion of our universe to accelerate? The outside crowd thinks big thoughts now and this is a development of only the last couple of decades.\nWhen I was in graduate school, a professor told me that Cosmology was “physics knitting.” Not any more! Cosmology in my and especially your generation is going to be flat-out amazing!\n\nAn Auspicious Beginning\n\nYes. The observable universe had a beginning, and quite a beginning it must have been: it was a roiling mess of radiation and elementary particles at temperatures never to be seen again. Everything that is—space, time, and all of energy—would have been confined into a size smaller than a baseball. Unthinkably dense and with growth that was stunningly rapid, our early universe defies imagination. It’s so outrageous that comprehending it seems a job for fiction and not science, yet my generation has also found ways to explore it: we probe it through direct telescope observations and we remake it in particle collisions. This is the blending of the outside with the inside pictures that motivates me.\n\nWait. I don’t believe in the big bang. You appear to, but isn’t what you think just another “belief”? Aren’t we each entitled to our own beliefs?  Glad you asked. “Belief” is a tricky word that we all use, although in our context, we should be clear and I’ll try to do that in the next lesson."

But while we use normal words in real life, some of them are different in scientific life.\nAs for the crying? Years ago I was triggered by a long argument in the state of Florida.\nAround 2008 the Florida State Board of Education was grappling with their “F” grade in a national review of science education. And, predictably instructions to teachers on how to teach evolution was a major issue. A few states insisted on teaching creationism, or the cloak-and-dagger idea of “Intelligent Design,” along side of, or in place of actual science.\nSo after many, many hearings, reports, testimony from Nobel laureates, and very public disputes, The fuss was resolved by mandating that whenever evolution was mentioned, it was to be referred to as the Theory of Evolution. By contrast, whenever Newton’s rule regarding gravity was used, it was to be called Newton’s Law of Gravitation. Law, good. Theory? Not good. Remembering this story is why I have on my unhappy face right now.[^law]\nSo I have rules (for myself) and in physics classes that I teach that can be summed up as:"

After thinking about this for many years I have reached a set of conclusions about the Nature of Science (NOS)1\nJust to be clear…it is after all my journal 😎 … I’ll not use the word “Law” when I describe scientific ideas.\n\nWait.

I will talk about historical scientific ideas which got labeled as “Law” but I’ll use lowercase, “law.” So: “Newton’s Second law.” Just to make the point: Newton’s Second “law” is not always correct since it was superseded by Einstein’s Theory of Special Relativity. Some “Law”! Notice that in modern use: It’s universally the Theory of Relativity, not Law of Relativity,\n\nThere are other words and phrases that deserve a scientific explanation and here are seven of them, followed by a snapshot of what I have in mind for each.

Please!\n\nThere are no Scientific Laws.\nScientific knowledge is a unique and reliable kind of knowledge.\nFacts change and there is no scientific Truth.\nTheories cannot be proven.\nWe don’t test a theories.

    "text": "1 It is not possible to test a theory. We test models.\nI’ve discarded Laws and truth and proof and so it’s time to confront the idea of a theory and how we can trust one or not. “What is a theory,” is a valid question.\nI’ve thought about this a lot. We have an idea of what a theory is, but do we directly test a theory? I don’t think so. I think we make models following the rules and suggestions of a theory and we then we test the model. I’ll try to explain why. Beware that this may be controversial…it’s my idea that may not have occurred to others unless they’ve been condemned to this dual life that I have of both a scientific and philosophical education. It’s a living, but it’s not easy.\n\n1.1 Planes, Trains, and Automobiles: Models\nWhen I was a kid, I was consumed by models of cars— “hot rods” of the 1960s. And airplanes. And HO train sets. In short, life-like replicas of transportation tools were my passion when I wasn’t playing or watching baseball.\nA plastic model stands for—represents—a real thing in the world, not perfectly, but well enough to complete a mission. In my case, that mission was a 13 year old boy imagining the car that he’d work on and own some day. If my plastic 1967 Chevy with baby moon wheels, GM 350 cubes with aluminum heads, Edelbrock intake manifold, Holley 4bbl, HPC Coated Headers w/Dual Exhaust, painted baby blue was made more and more precise, it would eventually become…a real car.\nchevybox.png intage Revell model ’57 Chevy. In the box.\nI’ve been careful in what I wrote in other posts to do two things. First, I referred to scientific statements and models of nature. Gone are the days when a physicist can construct a mathematical description of say a block of wood sliding down a plane of wood and proudly proclaim that what’s written in symbols on paper is a 1:1 faithful reproduction of what happens in the laboratory.\nNow we operate from a more hazy, removed vantage point. As we consider electric and magnetic fields, relativity, and quantum mechanics the correspondence between a mathematical description and what nature is supposed to be like will become necessarily more indirect and abstract.\nI now tend to think of a theory as a broad framework within which there are many ways to address nature from within the framework. But what we don’t do is test the theory, rather we build mathematical models that use the rules (from within the framework) of a theory to address a particular, well-defined piece of nature with predictions. Then experiments are done to test the model, not the theory.\nLet’s pick on Special Relativity again. I can tell you the Theory of Relativity in these three lines:\n\nThe rules of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe interval between two spacetime events is Minkowskian.\n\nThe first two statements are called the Postulates of Relativity and the last statement is a consequence of the mathematization of the theory in geometry.\nThis is the Theory of Relativity…the framework within which any scientific statement must fit. You don’t need to understand what these sentences mean, but you can surely see that they don’t contain a single mathematic equation. That’s where the models come in.\nIn my way of thinking, a mathematical model of nature is a little machine that you run to a result at the end when you add some information at the beginning. The result can be, and usually is, the prediction of what an experiment would find. That result can also be another equation, distilled from input equations.\nWe will use the Theory of Relativity quite a bit, but our confrontation with nature will be through models that are built within the framework of the Theory of Relativity.\nAn important aspect of a model is that it must respect a possible measurement’s capabilities. A model is not meant to be a 1:1 representation of nature, just like the model car is not a real car. It’s a limited representation that can be tested. Here’s what I mean.\nI can create a model for how fast a block will move across a table if it’s pushed with a given force. If that’s all I want to know, that’s a pretty easy thing to predict. But notice that it’s not the whole story of what goes on. The table and the block heat up and so energy is lost to the warming air. There are billions of little, complex atomic bonds between the under-surface of the block and the table-top. There’s a lot of physics involved in describing this event and how much detail I include in the model depends on a) what I want to know from my measurement and b) how well I need to know it. My model could include all of those thermodynamic and atomic effects but I wouldn’t include them if I can’t measure the speed very precisely.\nPhysicists learn to stick to the Goldilocks Rule of Modeling. A model can’t be too crude and a model can’t be too precise…a model needs to be Just Right.\nTo summarize:\n\naccept a theory and its rules; build mathematical models within the theory to represent nature (but not in a 1:1 sense);\nmake predictions from those models and test them in experiments;\naccept or reject the model based on the results of the experiments.\n\nThat’s the game that I’ve played for four decades in which I’ve never left the theory of quantum mechanics, the theory of special relativity, nor the theory of general relativity…but I’ve tested lots of models.\n\n1.1.1 Statements\nIt’s a detail, but an important one. We cannot test nature directly. We can only assess the truth or falsity only of statements. This reflects a remoteness of a scientist relative to nature itself. So a prediction and a test of that prediction is really testing statements and not theories and not nature. I confess this is hard to appreciate and I can probably argue even with myself about it.\npainting.png In some ways, what an artist does when she paints a landscape is make a model of it. Representation theory is a serious part of “Semiotics” which is a sophisticated discipline in philosophy, linguistics, and aesthetics.\n\n\n\n1.2 Memory Medicine: Confirmation and Disconfirmation\nIn my car I just heard an advertisement for a supplement that would make me remember things better. (I don’t remember its name…see what I did there?) It apparently has been “proven” to be effective. Well, by now you know my problems with that word, but what is it that scientists can actually say about a model and indirectly, the theory framework within which it functions?\nThe black squirrel issue makes it clear that proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that an inductive model is true is risky and historically unproductive.\n\nThe word that we use when evidence supports a model’s prediction is “confirm”…the model’s prediction is confirmed, definately not “proved.”\nThe word we use when a model’s prediction is contradicted is “disconfirmed.”\nThe burden of any model is that it must be “falsifiable” or in principle be disconfirmable.\n\nA couple of notes. “Confirm” is weaker than prove, leaving us the necessary freedom to allow that evidence can change our models and even theories. Those theories that I keep saying we trust? They have been confirmed many, many times. (It’s fair to think that maybe a Law is just a really, well-confirmed theory. But I’m fighting that older picture of Newtonian-like Laws.)\nThat last bullet is important and has a special place in the Philosophy of Science—and is the center of a couple of serious arguments in my fields of physics right now.\n\nYou might have heard some of this in the news and the falsifiability test of a theory (the word used then) is attributed to the philosopher, Karl Popper. He thought this was a worthy goal of science because showing something to be wrong is actually a deductive process, the inverse of showing that something agrees.\n\nTo a Popperian (my pejorative word) a single instance of disconfirmation should eliminate a model from study (they would say “theory”). A single black squirrel? That’s nice sounding, but not how science actually works and is philosophically troublesome (ask Mr Google about the Duhem–Quine thesis)–that black squirrel could have just been in a dust-bin.\n\nThe requirement of falsifiability as a standard required of science has pretty much stuck with us.\n\nCan you see how this in-principle falsifiability requirement actually feeds my original assertion above about how to tell if a statement is scientific or not? The latter is just a simpler version of the former.\nThe bottom line here is this:\n\nThe burden on science is not to prove things about nature, but to confirm or disconfirm statements about nature.\n\nIn QS&BB, we’ll watch revolutions in science that create large frameworks in which models are tested, rejected, and accepted. These frameworks I will call theories and I can list them for you:\n\nNewton’s laws of motion (remember?)\nNewton’s law of Gravitation\nMaxwell’s Theory of Electromagnetism\nQuantum Mechanics\nSpecial Relativity Theory\nThe General Theory of Relativity\n\nIn my picture, there are not many theories in physics.\nOther topics like the big bang? quarks? nuclear physics? the standard model of particle physics? These are all models within the currently acceptable theories (frameworks) of 4, 5, and 6 above. Numbers 1 and 2? They’ve been replaced!\n\n\n1.3 Laziness: Belief\nOne more word that both has no place in science but is one of those words we use all the time: Belief. We all talk about what we believe (and don’t), and scientists will sometimes colloquially do that in a scientific context, but that’s sloppy. When I say “I believe in X,” what I really mean is that that job that word does is act as a shorthand for the sentence: “X is highly confirmed by experiments and X is likely to survive foreseeable experimental tests if asked.” If I’m an expert in the field of X, then I have the obligation to describe those experimental tests. If I’m not an expert in X and I want to echo an expert’s “belief,” I should expect that expert could also enumerate its experimental successes in detail on my behalf. (That’s a little tricky.)\nThere are dos and don’ts here for scientists (and students of science). When it comes to belief in a scientific statement, I can’t do three things:\n\nI can’t say that I believe in X because I want to,\nI can’t say that I believe in X because my gut or a “feeling” suggests that I should, and\nI can’t say that I believe in X because just because a non-expert or an authoritative text tells me to. Likewise, I can’t say that I don’t believe in X for any of those same three reasons\n\n\n\n👈 Previous: 4.00 proof | Next: 6.00 reality 👉"

    "text": "1.1 Laws?\nIn the 1970s there was an unpopular national speed limit of 55 mph and the catch-phrase used to encourage compliance was: ‘It’s not just a good idea, it’s the law.’ That’s one interpretation of a law – you can obey or choose not to. But then there is the common expectation for Scientific Laws…certain, indisputable, irrefutable statements. Epic in their cosmic importance.\nThe popular notion of a Scientific Law is a statement that’s impossible to dispute: once it’s discovered, it’s almost biblical in its permanence. Once you’ve found a Law, man, you’re done. That’s it. That Law is way better than a theory. Go do something else.\nThis “Law” was incorporated into the description of physics following Isaac Newton’s almost super-human successes. Surely, he’d uncovered the God-given Laws of Nature and surely uncovering the Laws of Nature is now the goal of science. You’ll see all manner of “Laws” that follow Newton’s three Laws of Motion and Newton’s Gravitational Law: Snell’s Law, The First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics, the Law of Reflection, Faraday’s Law, Ampere’s Law…and so on, up to the 20th century when we got serious.\nFrom that point, it’s Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity, Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, Quantum Theory, Ginzburg–Landau Theory, Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Theory, Relativistic Quantum Field Theory, Inflation Theory, the Big Bang Theory, and so on. Are we just dumber than when all of science was uncovering Laws? No. Rather, around the turn of the 20th century the subtlety of science is was sinking in. But apparently not in Florida. onlytheory\nLet me tell you a story.\nThe speed of light\nWe’ll spend a lot of effort becoming comfortable with Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. One of its famous, bedrock rules is that the speed of light is the fastest that anything can travel. (BTW, that’s technically a “postulate,” not a law.) Relativity has been confirmed so many times that we use it as a tool and not a theory to be tested…Florida should call it the Law of Relativity. But we don’t. It’s the Theory of Relativity.\n\nThere is an elementary particle called the neutrino that is so light that it travels at almost the speed of light. In 2011 an experiment called Opera in a mountain in northern Italy was under way to measure properties of neutrinos coming from the CERN particle accelerator in Geneva, Switzerland, almost 1000 km away.\nIn order to be sure of the source of interactions, Opera had a sophisticated GPS system that measured times in Geneva and times in the mountain at a precision better than ±0.000000010 seconds (±10 nanoseconds). What they found was that the neutrinos appeared to arrive faster than the speed of light would allow, apparently violating the Theory of Relativity!\nIf Relativity were a Law of Nature in the Florida-way, say the “Law of Relativity”—then the surprising Opera measurement would have confronted the authority of the Law of Relativity and the scientists would back down: can’t cross that threshold of Law. But Opera scientists couldn’t do that. The experimenters worked very hard to redo their analyses and scoured their experimental apparatus for any place that the few nanoseconds might have been missing.\nI was a member of the Physics Advisory Committee at the Fermi National Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois which was running a similar experiment, shooting neutrinos from Illinois to a mine in northern Minnesota. We asked them and learned that they too saw an effect, but they used a conventional GPS and they couldn’t measure times precisely enough to test Opera… so we bought them a fancy – expensive – GPS system so they could check! Meanwhile many alternative explanations around Relativity were proposed to account for the measurement. Many, many. A small theoretical physics industry of alternative ideas.\nAfter a year or so, Opera discovered a subtle, tiny, but flawed optical fiber seating that accounted for the missing few nanoseconds and then were able to conclude that Einstein could rest easy. Meanwhile, Fermilab had a shiny, new GPS system.\n\nYou get the important part of this story? Relativity is among the most trusted theories in all of science — if anything could be labeled as “Law” then this is it! And yet, when faced with an apparent problem, we had to dig deeper.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n📝 The authority of Relativity is not absolute, it’s not Law-like, but a highly trusted theory.\n\n\nI was proud of my community during that episode. That’s how it’s supposed to work. There are no Laws of the capital L kind."

    "text": "1.2 My criterion for a proper scientific statement\nI’m treading into waters that force us to think about what is and what isn’t a proper scientific process. Historically. that’s the problem of demarcating Scientific Knowledge from “pseudo-science” statements. You may have heard that scientific statements must be “falsifiable,” an idea often credited to the philosopher of science (and other things), Karl Popper3\nHere’s my personal rule:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n🫵 In order for you to assert a statement about the natural world as legitimately scientific, you must be able to say what it would take to change your mind.\n\n\n\nNobody said, “Let’s ignore this evidence because Relativity must be true.” We all said, “Wow. A faster-than-light neutrino signal is probably a mistake but we’d better spend a year around the world checking it.”\n\n👍 Proponents of scientific statements can always tell you what evidence would force them to abandon one of their favorite theories, here, a superluminal particle qualifies as one of those pieces of evidence that could in-principle have overthrown Relativity.\n👎 Proponents of unscientific statements cannot – or will not – do that. The most obvious contemporary example of unscientific assertions are those that come from creationism or “intelligent design.” Unlike the Opera experience, proponents of these systems of belief hold that some parts of their knowledge live in territory that is off-limits for questioning.\n\nWait. Why shouldn’t students be taught both sides of such a disagreement about our origins?\nGlad you asked. That’s now called “teach the controversy“ and it’s not appropriate in a science class for two reasons. First, to put creationism in a science class goes against that crucial falsifiability requirement. So it’s not science. Second, science is not a democracy. There’s no requirement in how the universe works that it make people happy. It is what it is.\n\nIf you believe that “X” cannot be doubted? Then X may be some form of knowledge, but it’s not scientific knowledge.\n\nWait. What about Newtonian Gravitation! It’s used today even to determine satellite and spacecraft trajectories.  Glad you asked. A tiny bit of display math can answer that I hope\n\nHere is Newton’s Gravitational law (see what I did there? law not Law):\n\\[F = G\\frac{M_1M_2}{R_{12}}\\]\nIn words, this formula says that the force of gravitational attraction between two objects that have masses of \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\) and whose centers are separated by the distance \\(R_{12}\\) is that relationship. Let’s look at each piece:\n\n\\(G\\) is called the gravitational constant (or Newton’s constant). It’s very hard to measure and as a resut it’s the worst measured constant of nature of all. A question of scientific research today.\n\\(M\\) is the mass…which is a very complicated concept. As we speake, we are at work at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland trying to understand mass. A question of scientific research today.\n\\(R^2\\) …that “2” in the formula is a direct consequence of the presumption that we have three dimensions of space. It’s a measurable quantity – and is not very precisely determined and the notion that we have three and not more spacial dimensions is a question of scientific research today.\n\nSo every term in Newton’s Gravatation law is uncertain and theoretically of interest. Again, Laws shouldn’t do that.\n\nWait. So, what can you believe in?  Glad you asked. That’s an understandable concern for folks who don’t do science for a living. We have theories and they are all questionable. We must live in a world that is full of uncertainty and a scientific world where no idea is permanent. I suspect that’s uncomfortable for many but it’s our lives.\n\nSo “theories all the way down” really means that we have a few theories that we trust very well and we don’t question them now unless a surprise happens. And we have many theories that are not trusted as much. So not turtles all the way down, but theories of varying degrees of trustworthiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n📝 In QS&BB we’ll work with the nuts and bolts of science: theories and models and this site will consist of the stories of how theories came to be, how they were modified, how they disappeared, and how we know so much more about the universe as a result.\n\n\n\n\nNext: 2.00 models 👉"

It’s a baby picture of the universe taken when it only a few thousand of its 14 billion years old. Isn’t it cute? Below the horizon is a computer reconstruction of a proton-proton collision in my experiment, ATLAS, at the Large Hadron Collider at the international CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. I’ll talk a lot about what goes on here!\n\n\nWe’ll talk about what what both images mean, but I’ll mention here that the difference in that sky temperature image between the between orange and blue? 1 part in 100,000 of a degree.

This is demoralizing for us physicists since it can lead to misunderstanding about what science can and cannot do. After thinking about this for many years I have reached a set of conclusions about the Nature of Science (NOS)1\nJust to be clear…it is after all my blog 😎 … I’ll not use the word “Law” when I describe scientific ideas.\n\nWait. What about Newton’s Laws of motion?  Glad you asked. I will talk about historical scientific ideas which got labeled as “Law” but I’ll use “law.” So: Newton’s Second law. Just to make the point, that law is not always correct since it was superceded by Einstein’s Theory of Special Relativity. Some “Law”! See that modern use: It’s universally the Theory of Relativity, not Law of Relativity,\n\nThere are other words and phrases that deserve a scientific explanation and here are seven of them, followed by a snapshot of what I have in mind for each. Follow the links for more discussion. Please!\n\nThere are no Scientific Laws.\nScientific knowledge is a unique and reliable kind of knowledge.\nFacts change and there is no scientific Truth.\nTheories cannot be proven.\nWe don’t test a theories. We test models.\nThere is a reality “out there” and our understanding of it continuously improves.\nScience is what scientists do.\n\nSquirming yet?

If I go there and don’t find my keys then either I was wrong, or someone moved my keys. While frustrated, I recognize that I can be wrong about my personal knowledge and I have personal strategies to figure out how to find a lost item. My strategies are mine. Yours are yours. A standard acceptable kind of knowledge of key-finding isn’t necessary.\nBut scientific knowledge is a little different. First of all, scientists need to agree on facts and theories. I wouldn’t tell you that your way of finding your lost keys is the wrong way, but scientists disagree all the time about whether a path to a conclusion is properly scientific. There is a loose community-acceptable kind of scientific knowledge.\nOne thing about scientific knowledge is that it’s expressed in a language made up of words, images, and mathematics. Statements in this language are constructed to represent phenomena in the physical world. There’s the world out there and there’s our incomplete knowledge of the features of that world, so we represent it according to our needs and our capabilities. Take baseball.\nI can represent a baseball game many ways, from a minimal representation of the outcome to a maximal detailed description of every pitch, the wind velocity, the groundscrew’s cutting of the grass, to the amount of Turface Quick Dry™ used on the mound, to how the field was raked, and the precise height of the outfield walls. If all you need is a quick result, then the final score, runs, hits, and errors is the minimal represention of the game. Want more detail? Then the line score of runs scored every inning is a representation. The Box Score tells you what every player did during the game.\nYou represent the game according to the needs of the audence. Mind you, no representation is the actual game itself.\nLearning how to represent the world using scientific statements and how to evaluate scientific statements is an important part of learning to be a physicist. That “representation” is indirect, it’s not the thing. The “sky is blue” is a word-statement. The frequency of the light in that sky overhead is about 750 nanometers is a mathematical statement. A spectrographic display is an image statement. None of these are the actual phenomenon, nor are they an explanation of what caused the phenomenon. They are facts and our knowledge of them is limited to how well we can support each of the statements as they all have uncertainties."

    "text": "0.6 About facts.\nPerhaps by now you know that I’m not a fan of proving anything in science! If I prove a mathematical derivation, it’s permanent. Within the rules of mathematics, it cannot be wrong and will be…forever. But I’ve already been adamant about the lack of “Laws” in science so a proof is obviously not my favorite idea.\nThat’s a principled stand but there’s a more practical side that argues against proof. What about a fact? It seems reasonable to imagine that I can make a measurement and establish a fact, even prove a fact. A fact can be an existence-thing and it can be a number.\nLet me take the second first. Here’s a fact: the mass of an electron is \\(9.109 \\times 10^{31}\\) kg. I measure that and so will you. It’s in books. It’s in Wikipedia!\nBut this will sound silly, but it’s maybe one of the most important and most misunderstood things about a scientific fact. If you go an measure the mass of an electron, you might get \\(9.1093837139 \\times 10^{31}\\) kg. Those aren’t the same number. You might correctly point out that they’re close and that the second one is maybe more precise and you’d be right. But what then is the proof of the fact that the electron has a particular mass? My fact is then not your fact and we can’t prove personal facts and still be scientific.\nBut there’s more. If I were to measure the mass of the electron and report it as “\\(9.1093837139 \\times 10^{31}\\)” I’d lose my physicist union card. All…every single one…measurement of a physical “fact” is not just a number. It’s a number plus a declaration of how well I know that number…the “uncertainty.” Thankfully now when political polls are announced, the “margin of error” is reported. So if one candidate’s poll number is 49% and the other is 51% with a margin of error of 4%…they are tied. Nobody can be reported to be ahead.\nThe same thing is true in a scientific “fact” but besides the uncertainty inherent to the number of measurements (statistical uncertainty), there are uncertainties inherent to the measurement device used. If I have a ruler marked off in only whole inches, and I measure something to be 2.5 inches long, then there’s an inherent uncertainty in that measurement that’s a significant fraction of an inch.\nSo. Facts about the natural world cannot be proven in the same sense that a mathematical proof can be proven. So when being precise in our language, scientists do not speak of having proven a fact."

So really when one is evaluating the believability of a scientific idea…what you’re really evaluating is a set of statements about that idea. In everyday life, I might toss off a thought casually, without preparation or much analysis. You know, like in a normal conversation. But a scientific statement isn’t like that.

    "text": "0.8 It is not possible to test a theory. We test models.\nI’ve discarded Laws and truth and proof and so it’s time to confront the idea of a theory and how we can trust one or not. “What is a theory,” is a valid question.\n\n0.8.1 Planes, Trains, and Automobiles: Models\nWhen I was a kid, I was consumed by models of cars— “hot rods” of the 1960s. And airplanes. And HO train sets. In short, life-like replicas of transportation tools were my passion when I wasn’t playing or watching baseball.\nA plastic model stands for—represents—a real thing in the world, not perfectly, but well enough to complete a mission. In my case, that mission was a 13 year old boy imagining the car that he’d work on and own some day. If my plastic 1967 Chevy with baby moon wheels, GM 350 cubes with aluminum heads, Edelbrock intake manifold, Holley 4bbl, HPC Coated Headers w/Dual Exhaust, painted baby blue was made more and more precise, it would eventually become…a real car.\nchevybox.png intage Revell model ’57 Chevy. In the box.\nI’ve been careful in what I wrote above to do two things. First, I referred to scientific statements and models of nature. Gone are the days when a physicist can construct a mathematical description of say a block of wood sliding down a plane of wood and proudly proclaim that what’s written in symbols on paper is a 1:1 faithful reproduction of what happens in the laboratory.\nNow we operate from a more hazy, removed vantage point. As we get into electric and magnetic fields, relativity, and quantum mechanics the correspondence between a mathematical description and what nature is supposed to be like will become necessarily more indirect and abstract.\nI now tend to think of a theory as a broad framework within which there are many ways to address nature from within the framework. But what we don’t do is test the theory, rather we build mathematical models that use the rules (from within the framework) of a theory to address a particular, well-defined piece of nature with predictions. Then experiments are done to test the model, not the theory.\nLet’s pick on Special Relativity again. I can tell you the Theory of Relativity in these three lines:\n\nThe rules of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe interval between two spacetime events is Minkowskian.\n\nThe first two statements are called the Postulates of Relativity and the last statement is a consequence of the mathematization of the theory in geometry.\nThis is the Theory of Relativity…the framework within which any scientific statement must fit. You don’t need to understand what these sentences mean, but you can surely see that they don’t contain a single mathematic equation. That’s where the models come in.\nIn my way of thinking, a mathematical model of nature is a little machine that you a result at the end when you add some information at the beginning. The result can be, and usually is, the prediction of what an experiment would find. That result can also be another equation, distilled from input equations.\nWe will use the Theory of Relativity above quite a bit, but our confrontation with nature will be through models that are built within the framework of the Theory of Relativity.\nAn important aspect of a model is that it must respect a possible measurement’s capabilities. A model is not meant to be a 1:1 representation of nature, just like the model car is not a real car. It’s a limited representation that can be tested. Here’s what I mean.\nI can create a model for how fast a block will move across a table if it’s pushed with a given force. If that’s all I want to know, that’s a pretty easy thing to predict. But notice that it’s not the whole story of what goes on. The table and the block heat up and so energy is lost to the warming air. There are billions of little, complex atomic bonds between the under-surface of the block and the table-top. There’s a lot of physics involved in describing this event and how much detail I include in the model depends on a) what I want to know from my measurement and b) how well I need to know it. My model could include all of those thermodynamic and atomic effects but I wouldn’t include them if I can’t measure the speed very precisely.\nPhysicists learn to stick to the Goldilocks Rule of Modeling. A model can’t be too crude and a model can’t be too precise…a model needs to be Just Right.\nTo summarize:\n\naccept a theory and its rules; build mathematical models within the theory to represent nature (but not in a 1:1 sense);\nmake predictions from those models and test them in experiments;\naccept or reject the model based on the results of the experiments.\n\nThat’s the game that I’ve played for four decades in which I’ve never left the theory of quantum mechanics, the theory of special relativity, nor the theory of general relativity…but I’ve tested lots of models.\n\n0.8.1.1 Statements\nIt’s a detail, but an important one. We cannot test nature directly. We can only assess the truth or falsity only of statements. This reflects a remoteness of a scientist relative to nature itself. So a prediction and a test of that prediction is really testing statements and not theories and not nature. I confess this is hard to appreciate and I can probably argue even with myself about it.\npainting.png In some ways, what an artist does when she paints a landscape is make a model of it. Representation theory is a serious part of “Semiotics” which is a sophisticated discipline in philosophy, linguistics, and aesthetics.\n\n\n\n0.8.2 Memory Medicine: Confirmation and Disconfirmation\nIn my car I just heard an advertisement for a supplement that would make me remember things better. (I don’t remember its name…see what I did there?) It apparently has been “proven” to be effective. Well, by now you know my problems with that word, but what is it that scientists can actually say about a model and indirectly, the theory framework within which it functions?\nThe black squirrel issue makes it clear that proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that an inductive model is true is risky and historically unproductive.\n\nThe word that we use when evidence supports a model’s prediction is “confirm”…the model’s prediction is confirmed, definately not “proved.”\nThe word we use when a model’s prediction is contradicted is “disconfirmed.”\nThe burden of any model is that it must be “falsifiable” or in principle be disconfirmable.\n\nA couple of notes. “Confirm” is weaker than prove, leaving us the necessary freedom to allow that evidence can change our models and even theories. Those theories that I keep saying we trust? They have been confirmed many, many times. (It’s fair to think that maybe a Law is just a really, well-confirmed theory. But I’m fighting that older picture of Newtonian-like Laws.)\nThat last bullet is important and has a special place in the Philosophy of Science—and is the center of a couple of serious arguments in my fields of physics right now.\n\nYou might have heard some of this in the news and the falsifiability test of a theory (the word used then) is attributed to the philosopher, Karl Popper. He thought this was a worthy goal of science because showing something to be wrong is actually a deductive process, the inverse of showing that something agrees.\n\nTo a Popperian (my pejorative word) a single instance of disconfirmation should eliminate a model from study (they would say “theory”). A single black squirrel? That’s nice sounding, but not how science actually works and is philosophically troublesome (ask Mr Google about the Duhem–Quine thesis)–that black squirrel could have just been in a dust-bin.\n\nThe requirement of falsifiability as a standard required of science has pretty much stuck with us.\n\nCan you see how this in-principle falsifiability requirement actually feeds my original assertion above about how to tell if a statement is scientific or not? The latter is just a simpler version of the former.\nThe bottom line here is this:\n\nThe burden on science is not to prove things about nature, but to confirm or disconfirm statements about nature.\n\nIn QS&BB, we’ll watch revolutions in science that create large frameworks in which models are tested, rejected, and accepted. These frameworks I will call theories and I can list them for you:\n\nNewton’s laws of motion (remember?)\nNewton’s law of Gravitation\nMaxwell’s Theory of Electromagnetism\nQuantum Mechanics\nSpecial Relativity Theory\nThe General Theory of Relativity\n\nIn my picture, there are not many theories in physics.\nOther topics like the big bang? quarks? nuclear physics? the standard model of particle physics? These are all models within the currently acceptable theories (frameworks) of 4, 5, and 6 above. Numbers 1 and 2? They’ve been replaced!\n\n\n0.8.3 Laziness: Belief\nOne more word that both has no place in science but is one of those words we use all the time: Belief. We all talk about what we believe (and don’t), and scientists will sometimes colloquially do that in a scientific context, but that’s sloppy. When I say “I believe in X,” what I really mean is that that job that word does is act as a shorthand for the sentence: “X is highly confirmed by experiments and X is likely to survive foreseeable experimental tests if asked.” If I’m an expert in the field of X, then I have the obligation to describe those experimental tests. If I’m not an expert in X and I want to echo an expert’s “belief,” I should expect that expert could also enumerate its experimental successes in detail on my behalf. (That’s a little tricky.)\nThere are dos and don’ts here for scientists (and students of science). When it comes to belief in a scientific statement, I can’t do three things:\n\nI can’t say that I believe in X because I want to,\nI can’t say that I believe in X because my gut or a “feeling” suggests that I should, and\nI can’t say that I believe in X because just because a non-expert or an authoritative text tells me to. Likewise, I can’t say that I don’t believe in X for any of those same three reasons."

The Nobel physicist from the University of Texas, Stephen Weinberg is both a prolific scientist, but also a writer of non-specialist books, the most famous being The First Three Minutes. One of his later books for the public is Dreams of a Final Theory and his last chapter is called Against Philosophy where he notes, “I know how philosophers feel about attempts by scientists at amateur philosophy. But I do not aim here to play the role of a philosopher, but rather that of a specimen, an unregenerate working scientist who finds no help in professional philosophy. I am not alone in this; I know of no one who has participated actively in the advance of physics in the postwar period whose research has been significantly helped by the work of philosophers.”\nOne of the more disturbing ways in which philosophy of science has drifted is in the denial of the project of science as learning about the physical world. Rather, science is deemed to be a social activity without the ability"

Evidence can lead to the overthrow if previously trusted theories. Facts can lose their permanence, proof is impossible except in mathematics, and models are meant to be tested, revised, and tested again.\nDoesn’t this go against the common notion that science is the final arbiter of truth? It’s complicated and when this contingency meets a unique pandemic and scientists are building the airplane while they’re flying it, in public, misunderstanding can be the result."

    "text": "2.1 Laws?\nIn the 1970s there was an unpopular national speed limit of 55 mph and the catch-phrase used to encourage compliance was: ‘It’s not just a good idea, it’s the law.’ That’s one interpretation of a law – you can obey or choose not to. But then there is the common expectation for Scientific Laws…certain, indisputable, irrefutable statements. Epic in their cosmic importance.\nThe popular notion of a Scientific Law is a statement that’s impossible to dispute: once it’s discovered, it’s almost biblical in its permanence. Once you’ve found a Law, man, you’re done. That’s it. That Law is way better than a theory. Go do something else.\nThis “Law” was incorporated into the description of physics following Isaac Newton’s almost super-human successes. Surely, he’d uncovered the God-given Laws of Nature and surely uncovering the Laws of Nature is now the goal of science. You’ll see all manner of “Laws” that follow Newton’s three Laws of Motion and Newton’s Gravitational Law: Snell’s Law, The First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics, the Law of Reflection, Faraday’s Law, Ampere’s Law…and so on, up to the 20th century when we got serious.\nFrom that point, it’s Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity, Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, Quantum Theory, Ginzburg–Landau Theory, Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Theory, Relativistic Quantum Field Theory, Inflation Theory, the Big Bang Theory, and so on. Are we just dumber than when all of science was uncovering Laws? No. Rather, around the turn of the 20th century the subtlety of science is was sinking in. But apparently not in Florida. onlytheory\nLet me tell you a story.\nThe speed of light\nWe’ll spend a lot of effort becoming comfortable with Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. One of its famous, bedrock rules is that the speed of light is the fastest that anything can travel. (BTW, that’s technically a “postulate,” not a law.) Relativity has been confirmed so many times that we use it as a tool and not a theory to be tested…Florida should call it the Law of Relativity. But we don’t. It’s the Theory of Relativity.\n\nThere is an elementary particle called the neutrino that is so light that it travels at almost the speed of light. In 2011 an experiment called Opera in a mountain in northern Italy was under way to measure properties of neutrinos coming from the CERN particle accelerator in Geneva, Switzerland, almost 1000 km away.\nIn order to be sure of the source of interactions, Opera had a sophisticated GPS system that measured times in Geneva and times in the mountain at a precision better than ±0.000000010 seconds (±10 nanoseconds). What they found was that the neutrinos appeared to arrive faster than the speed of light would allow, apparently violating the Theory of Relativity!\nIf Relativity were a Law of Nature in the Florida-way, say the “Law of Relativity”—then the surprising Opera measurement would have confronted the authority of the Law of Relativity and the scientists would back down: can’t cross that threshold of Law. But Opera scientists couldn’t do that. The experimenters worked very hard to redo their analyses and scoured their experimental apparatus for any place that the few nanoseconds might have been missing.\nI was a member of the Physics Advisory Committee at the Fermi National Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois which was running a similar experiment, shooting neutrinos from Illinois to a mine in northern Minnesota. We asked them and learned that they too saw an effect, but they used a conventional GPS and they couldn’t measure times precisely enough to test Opera… so we bought them a fancy – expensive – GPS system so they could check! Meanwhile many alternative explanations around Relativity were proposed to account for the measurement. Many, many. A small theoretical physics industry of alternative ideas.\nAfter a year or so, Opera discovered a subtle, tiny, but flawed optical fiber seating that accounted for the missing few nanoseconds and then were able to conclude that Einstein could rest easy. Meanwhile, Fermilab had a shiny, new GPS system.\n\nYou get the important part of this story? Relativity is among the most trusted theories in all of science — if anything could be labeled as “Law” then this is it! And yet, when faced with an apparent problem, we had to dig deeper.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n📝 The authority of Relativity is not absolute, it’s not Law-like, but a highly trusted theory.\n\n\nI was proud of my community during that episode. That’s how it’s supposed to work. There are no Laws of the capital L kind."

    "text": "2.2 My criterion for a proper scientific statement\nI’m treading into waters that force us to think about what is and what isn’t a proper scientific process. Historically. that’s the problem of demarcating Scientific Knowledge from “pseudo-science” statements. You may have heard that scientific statements must be “falsifiable,” an idea often credited to the philosopher of science (and other things), Karl Popper3\nHere’s my personal rule:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n🫵 In order for you to assert a statement about the natural world as legitimately scientific, you must be able to say what it would take to change your mind.\n\n\n\nNobody said, “Let’s ignore this evidence because Relativity must be true.” We all said, “Wow. A faster-than-light neutrino signal is probably a mistake but we’d better spend a year around the world checking it.”\n\n👍 Proponents of scientific statements can always tell you what evidence would force them to abandon one of their favorite theories, here, a superluminal particle qualifies as one of those pieces of evidence that could in-principle have overthrown Relativity.\n👎 Proponents of unscientific statements cannot – or will not – do that. The most obvious contemporary example of unscientific assertions are those that come from creationism or “intelligent design.” Unlike the Opera experience, proponents of these systems of belief hold that some parts of their knowledge live in territory that is off-limits for questioning.\n\nWait. Why shouldn’t students be taught both sides of such a disagreement about our origins?\nGlad you asked. That’s now called “teach the controversy“ and it’s not appropriate in a science class for two reasons. First, to put creationism in a science class goes against that crucial falsifiability requirement. So it’s not science. Second, science is not a democracy. There’s no requirement in how the universe works that it make people happy. It is what it is.\n\nIf you believe that “X” cannot be doubted? Then X may be some form of knowledge, but it’s not scientific knowledge.\n\nWait. What about Newtonian Gravitation! It’s used today even to determine satellite and spacecraft trajectories.  Glad you asked. A tiny bit of display math can answer that I hope\n\nHere is Newton’s Gravitational law (see what I did there? law not Law):\n\\[F = G\\frac{M_1M_2}{R_{12}}\\]\nIn words, this formula says that the force of gravitational attraction between two objects that have masses of \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\) and whose centers are separated by the distance \\(R_{12}\\) is that relationship. Let’s look at each piece:\n\n\\(G\\) is called the gravitational constant (or Newton’s constant). It’s very hard to measure and as a resut it’s the worst measured constant of nature of all. A question of scientific research today.\n\\(M\\) is the mass…which is a very complicated concept. As we speake, we are at work at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland trying to understand mass. A question of scientific research today.\n\\(R^2\\) …that “2” in the formula is a direct consequence of the presumption that we have three dimensions of space. It’s a measurable quantity – and is not very precisely determined and the notion that we have three and not more spacial dimensions is a question of scientific research today.\n\nSo every term in Newton’s Gravatation law is uncertain and theoretically of interest. Again, Laws shouldn’t do that.\n\nWait. So, what can you believe in?  Glad you asked. That’s an understandable concern for folks who don’t do science for a living. We have theories and they are all questionable. We must live in a world that is full of uncertainty and a scientific world where no idea is permanent. I suspect that’s uncomfortable for many but it’s our lives.\n\nSo “theories all the way down” really means that we have a few theories that we trust very well and we don’t question them now unless a surprise happens. And we have many theories that are not trusted as much. So not turtles all the way down, but theories of varying degrees of trustworthiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n📝 In QS&BB we’ll work with the nuts and bolts of science: theories and models and this site will consist of the stories of how theories came to be, how they were modified, how they disappeared, and how we know so much more about the universe as a result."

Rules-based knowledge that’s not science is probably the Law. What you say, how you say it, and how you justify it is pretty much the whole game for the legal profession.\n👉 For me, I think that #5 above is key. It removes “proof” and “truth” from the game since everything you assert must come with an uncertainty. There’s no analog to this in everyday knowledge production and consumption. In fact, polemic everyday knowledge is usually, aggressively certain."

    "text": "7.1 Theories cannot be proven.\n“Just the facts, Ma’am.” An iconic catch-phrase uttered by Detective Joe Friday on the 1950’s crime show, Dragnet. Everyone knows what a fact is, right? Well it’s a fact that Joe Friday never said that line in the TV program, but ask anyone over the age of 60 and chances are that they will agree that it’s a fact that Detective Friday uttered that line in every episode. But he didn’t. That’s an urban myth born of a popular 1953 spoof of the program, Little Blue Riding Hood. Google it and listen (it’s only 3 minutes).\n“Fact” is another one of those words. You might want to say that science consists of facts arranged in order to support or define theories…or just collect data or artifacts. There’s an assumption built into that sentiment: on the one hand there are facts about the world and on the other hand, there are opinions about the world and science works hard to separate the two…and reserve “facts” as the fuel for theories and guard against opinion from influencing that process. That’s the case. But like Law, this burden given to “fact” sometimes assigns to it the responsibility of being a “true thing.” But even in everyday life, let alone in nearly every crime novel ever written, facts depend on evidence and evidence is a set of informed observations. And observations change, they evolve, or they can be mistaken.\nA plausible-sounding, if simplified cartoon of the scientific method might be: evidence \\(\\to\\) facts \\(\\to\\) Laws. But if Laws are not forever, where in this chain does uncertainty sneak in? Obviously, it’s that evidence and facts are not permanent. It was a fact that the evidence pointed to the fact that all objects move slower than the speed of light, but when the evidence appeared to change we were prepared to dispute the theory and so Relativity as a Law in the Florida-sense didn’t fit.\nMore appropriate is a chain that goes like: evidence \\(\\to\\) facts \\(\\to\\) theories. And then depending on the accumulation of the evidence that justify the facts, we have theories we trust a lot and theories we’re just beginning to get to know. But since evidence is contingent, facts are contingent, and so theories are contingent. Any or all can change and it takes a professional scientist to know when to pull the plug on any one of them."

    "text": "7.2 It is not possible to prove a theory.\nOkay, if you’re with me this far, you’re tentatively prepared to go along with the idea that indeed, it’s theories all the way down. Our theories are supported by facts which in turn are justified by evidence. But if the established facts support the theory, doesn’t that “prove” it?\n\nWait. Doesn’t that just take us back to Laws as “proven theories”?\nGlad you asked. That sounds like a word-game, but it’s more. Can there every be enough evidence?\n\n\n7.2.1 Frogs and Squirrels: Proof\nMy impression of the normal use of “prove” — and yours, I’ll bet—implies something that’s final and beyond question. Its everyday usage probably comes from memories of mathematical proofs, which are iron-clad processes of reaching a conclusion through a series of deductions from a set of premises. Look at this figure:\nsyllogysm.png If the words were not enough, a Venn diagram should make it unavoidably clear: C is all within A, so Socrates is mortal. Can’t get any more confident of the conclusion than this!\nThe blue figure represents all men who are Socrates, the green circle represents all people who are men, and the red circle represents all mortals who are men. It’s logically impossible to claim that this diagram would allow any Socrates to not also be mortal.\nThis is the essence of one of the simplest forms of deductive reasoning called the syllogism. It was Aristotle’s invention and his favorite and this is his example which is as obvious today as it was for Aristotle’s students and friends. Even if it’s not written in ancient Greek! Here it is in its formal layout:\n\nAll men are mortal.\nSocrates is a man.\nTherefore, Socrates is mortal.\n\nThe power of this is not about Socrates, but the general nature of the form of the argument. It’s mathematical in nature. Do you remember the “transitive property” of arithmetic? If \\(A = B\\) and \\(B=C\\) then \\(A=C\\)? This is precisely the same story about Socrates but dressed up to look like middle school math without any reference to a gadfly philosopher or the species of men. Within the tight little universe of the assertions and the conclusion, there is no room for dispute in a deductive argument: Socrates can be nothing but mortal, \\(A\\) cannot be anything but \\(C\\).\nSince deduction is how you go from one point to the next in a proof, it’s easy to see why “proof” carries a heavy responsibility and that’s the problem with using the word “proof” in a scientific context.\nRene Descartes in the 17th century was the paradigm deduction champion at the beginning of modern western philosophy and tried to take that method into physics (which was called natural philosophy). Newton was at first a fan, but then changed his tune.\nDo you learn anything new from a deductive proof? In going from premises to conclusion nothing entered the process that wasn’t already there to begin with, so the conclusion seems to be “inside” of the premises all along! This was so important to Plato, that he decided that one already knows mathematics and that you are actually remembering things in a deductive proof that you already knew. You’d just forgotten.\nJust to be perverse, here’s another syllogism of exactly the same form as the previous one:\n\nAll frogs are coffee pots.\nThis animal is a frog.\nTherefore, this animal is a coffee pot.\n\nThis has exactly the same validity as the Socrates example—it fits the Venn diagram. But nobody would accuse a frog of being a kitchen appliance. Obviously, the viability of the premises in a deductive argument makes the whole thing sensible…or nonsense. Dare I ask, is it a fact that frogs are coffee pots? If it were so, then the syllogism is not only formally correct, but also leads to a reasonable conclusion about green amphibians.\nDoes science work this way? There was a time in the 17th and 18th century—the “Scientific Revolution” time—when marvels were being unearthed and thousands of years-old puzzles were being explained. The successes were so impressive that it came to be appreciated that maybe this new invention of science must be taking us directly to nature’s truths. We now know that science is not that clean.\nBefore I moved to East Lansing I’d seen lots of squirrels in my life. They were all brown and I had created a Theory of Squirrels in my brain that said, “All squirrels are brown.” Indeed, I would have said that it was a fact that squirrels are brown and that fact was justified by my many observations of squirrels, all of which were brown. That’s lots of squirrels.\nImagine my surprise in 1980 when I saw hundreds of black squirrels in my new Michigan town. My justification took a turn for the worse. My theory of squirrels was defeated. (Luckily I’d not announced a Law of Squirrels!) I later learned that the black squirrel had been intentionally brought to the Michigan State campus in the 1950s and obviously spread to town. So if I’d moved to Michigan in the 1940’s my theory of squirrels would have received continued justification.\nI was reminded that reasoning by induction is risky and that facts can change.\nRemember induction? It’s “the other” form of reasoning where you observe a pattern or some process over and over—maybe under controlled (scientific?) conditions—and then abstract from those observations to a general statement of fact. The facts are a statement of what I know up until now, but my theory is a framework that permits me to predict the future. You can imagine that for the first 30 years of my life I was constantly uttering:\n“There’s a brown squirrel.\nThere’s another brown squirrel.\nThere’s another brown squirrel.\nThere’s another brown squirrel.\nThere’s another brown squirrel.”\nIn my 20’s maybe: “It is a fact that my observed squirrels are all brown.”\nThen, triumphantly, “My theory of squirrels is that all squirrels are brown.”\nThat’s induction. But a theory that comes from induction is subject to modification or even rejection since only a single instance can disappoint. (By the way, I’d insist that every observation of a brown squirrel was factual! I was justified in every observation that brownness was what that squirrel presented to me.\nCertainly there’s a lot of induction in science. In fact Galileo’s contemporary and correspondent Francis Bacon enthusiastically built a case for science based on induction—at about the same time that Descartes did the same thing for deduction. Both have their uses today. A mathematical physicist is likely to be deducing consequences of theories and models, an experimental physicist is likely to be inductively drawing conclusions from patterns in data, while that same experimental physicist is likely to be using deduction in the process of debugging malfunctioning equipment, and an electrical engineer or scientist designing digital electronic circuits will be deeply immersed in the individual components in a circuit that explicitly uses deductive logic.\nSo one logical size doesn’t fit all, but it’s even more interesting. A case can be made that the process that’s closest to a recognizable science is the form of reasoning called abduction which is more like what a detective does, at least in fiction. One reasons to the most likely conclusion. You do this all the time:\n\nSuppose your car won’t start. There are a thousand reasons why that be the case: it could be fairies, it could be an evil spell, it could be a prank from your roommate (who’s always a pain), it could be that your battery is old and you listened to the radio last night after shutting off the engine, it could be that you’re out of gas. Because of a variety of experiences you’ve had regarding mystical creatures, magic, the fact that your roommate is out of town, how batteries are rumored to work, and that you’d filled your tank the day before would cause you to abduct to the conclusion that your battery is probably discharged because of its age. Abduction is the most recognizable form of reasoning that scientists generally engage in. It involves expertise, it is not iron-clad (you could have a leak in your gas tank), and it’s not based on a string of observations like brown squirrels.\n\n\nWas Sherlock Holmes the Master of Deduction? Nope. He was the Master of Abduction.\n\nCan you imagine that it’s hard to be sure? Absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, sure about something that’s discovered in nature? We cannot be. The assumption about frogs and coffee pots might have come from an abductive process, and a chain of deductive logic might lead you to a conclusion that you’d like to declare is a true statement about nature. But we’d have been wrong.\nWe’ll see below that what we test are models of nature. The consequences of a model are deductive in that the chain of reasoning leads from assumptions to what should happen in the future—a prediction. It’s those pesky assumptions that make the whole process contingent and impermanent: no absolute truth and certainly no proof. I’ll leave you with this:\n\nParticles cannot go faster than the speed of light.\nNeutrinos are particles.\nNeutrinos cannot go faster than the speed of light.\n\nHad we taken that first premise to be indisputable—true forever and ever and beyond questioning—then we would not have taken the Opera claim seriously. But that’s not how science works and not what the community did. We worked hard to find evidence that the first premise was not a fact (that maybe it was a black squirrel). We’re now more trusting of the conclusion about the speed of light which wouldn’t have occurred without that nervous year."

    "text": "8.1 It is not possible to test a theory. We test models.\nI’ve discarded Laws and truth and proof and so it’s time to confront the idea of a theory and how we can trust one or not. “What is a theory,” is a valid question.\nI’ve thought about this a lot. We have an idea of what a theory is, but do we directly test a theory? I don’t think so. I think we make models following the rules and suggestions of a theory and we then we test the model. I’ll try to explain why. Beware that this may be controversial…it’s my idea that may not have occurred to others unless they’ve been condemned to this dual life that I have of both a scientific and philosophical education. It’s a living, but it’s not easy.\n\n8.1.1 Planes, Trains, and Automobiles: Models\nWhen I was a kid, I was consumed by models of cars— “hot rods” of the 1960s. And airplanes. And HO train sets. In short, life-like replicas of transportation tools were my passion when I wasn’t playing or watching baseball.\nA plastic model stands for—represents—a real thing in the world, not perfectly, but well enough to complete a mission. In my case, that mission was a 13 year old boy imagining the car that he’d work on and own some day. If my plastic 1967 Chevy with baby moon wheels, GM 350 cubes with aluminum heads, Edelbrock intake manifold, Holley 4bbl, HPC Coated Headers w/Dual Exhaust, painted baby blue was made more and more precise, it would eventually become…a real car.\nchevybox.png intage Revell model ’57 Chevy. In the box.\nI’ve been careful in what I wrote in other posts to do two things. First, I referred to scientific statements and models of nature. Gone are the days when a physicist can construct a mathematical description of say a block of wood sliding down a plane of wood and proudly proclaim that what’s written in symbols on paper is a 1:1 faithful reproduction of what happens in the laboratory.\nNow we operate from a more hazy, removed vantage point. As we consider electric and magnetic fields, relativity, and quantum mechanics the correspondence between a mathematical description and what nature is supposed to be like will become necessarily more indirect and abstract.\nI now tend to think of a theory as a broad framework within which there are many ways to address nature from within the framework. But what we don’t do is test the theory, rather we build mathematical models that use the rules (from within the framework) of a theory to address a particular, well-defined piece of nature with predictions. Then experiments are done to test the model, not the theory.\nLet’s pick on Special Relativity again. I can tell you the Theory of Relativity in these three lines:\n\nThe rules of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe interval between two spacetime events is Minkowskian.\n\nThe first two statements are called the Postulates of Relativity and the last statement is a consequence of the mathematization of the theory in geometry.\nThis is the Theory of Relativity…the framework within which any scientific statement must fit. You don’t need to understand what these sentences mean, but you can surely see that they don’t contain a single mathematic equation. That’s where the models come in.\nIn my way of thinking, a mathematical model of nature is a little machine that you run to a result at the end when you add some information at the beginning. The result can be, and usually is, the prediction of what an experiment would find. That result can also be another equation, distilled from input equations.\nWe will use the Theory of Relativity quite a bit, but our confrontation with nature will be through models that are built within the framework of the Theory of Relativity.\nAn important aspect of a model is that it must respect a possible measurement’s capabilities. A model is not meant to be a 1:1 representation of nature, just like the model car is not a real car. It’s a limited representation that can be tested. Here’s what I mean.\nI can create a model for how fast a block will move across a table if it’s pushed with a given force. If that’s all I want to know, that’s a pretty easy thing to predict. But notice that it’s not the whole story of what goes on. The table and the block heat up and so energy is lost to the warming air. There are billions of little, complex atomic bonds between the under-surface of the block and the table-top. There’s a lot of physics involved in describing this event and how much detail I include in the model depends on a) what I want to know from my measurement and b) how well I need to know it. My model could include all of those thermodynamic and atomic effects but I wouldn’t include them if I can’t measure the speed very precisely.\nPhysicists learn to stick to the Goldilocks Rule of Modeling. A model can’t be too crude and a model can’t be too precise…a model needs to be Just Right.\nTo summarize:\n\naccept a theory and its rules; build mathematical models within the theory to represent nature (but not in a 1:1 sense);\nmake predictions from those models and test them in experiments;\naccept or reject the model based on the results of the experiments.\n\nThat’s the game that I’ve played for four decades in which I’ve never left the theory of quantum mechanics, the theory of special relativity, nor the theory of general relativity…but I’ve tested lots of models.\n\n8.1.1.1 Statements\nIt’s a detail, but an important one. We cannot test nature directly. We can only assess the truth or falsity only of statements. This reflects a remoteness of a scientist relative to nature itself. So a prediction and a test of that prediction is really testing statements and not theories and not nature. I confess this is hard to appreciate and I can probably argue even with myself about it.\npainting.png In some ways, what an artist does when she paints a landscape is make a model of it. Representation theory is a serious part of “Semiotics” which is a sophisticated discipline in philosophy, linguistics, and aesthetics.\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Memory Medicine: Confirmation and Disconfirmation\nIn my car I just heard an advertisement for a supplement that would make me remember things better. (I don’t remember its name…see what I did there?) It apparently has been “proven” to be effective. Well, by now you know my problems with that word, but what is it that scientists can actually say about a model and indirectly, the theory framework within which it functions?\nThe black squirrel issue makes it clear that proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that an inductive model is true is risky and historically unproductive.\n\nThe word that we use when evidence supports a model’s prediction is “confirm”…the model’s prediction is confirmed, definately not “proved.”\nThe word we use when a model’s prediction is contradicted is “disconfirmed.”\nThe burden of any model is that it must be “falsifiable” or in principle be disconfirmable.\n\nA couple of notes. “Confirm” is weaker than prove, leaving us the necessary freedom to allow that evidence can change our models and even theories. Those theories that I keep saying we trust? They have been confirmed many, many times. (It’s fair to think that maybe a Law is just a really, well-confirmed theory. But I’m fighting that older picture of Newtonian-like Laws.)\nThat last bullet is important and has a special place in the Philosophy of Science—and is the center of a couple of serious arguments in my fields of physics right now.\n\nYou might have heard some of this in the news and the falsifiability test of a theory (the word used then) is attributed to the philosopher, Karl Popper. He thought this was a worthy goal of science because showing something to be wrong is actually a deductive process, the inverse of showing that something agrees.\n\nTo a Popperian (my pejorative word) a single instance of disconfirmation should eliminate a model from study (they would say “theory”). A single black squirrel? That’s nice sounding, but not how science actually works and is philosophically troublesome (ask Mr Google about the Duhem–Quine thesis)–that black squirrel could have just been in a dust-bin.\n\nThe requirement of falsifiability as a standard required of science has pretty much stuck with us.\n\nCan you see how this in-principle falsifiability requirement actually feeds my original assertion above about how to tell if a statement is scientific or not? The latter is just a simpler version of the former.\nThe bottom line here is this:\n\nThe burden on science is not to prove things about nature, but to confirm or disconfirm statements about nature.\n\nIn QS&BB, we’ll watch revolutions in science that create large frameworks in which models are tested, rejected, and accepted. These frameworks I will call theories and I can list them for you:\n\nNewton’s laws of motion (remember?)\nNewton’s law of Gravitation\nMaxwell’s Theory of Electromagnetism\nQuantum Mechanics\nSpecial Relativity Theory\nThe General Theory of Relativity\n\nIn my picture, there are not many theories in physics.\nOther topics like the big bang? quarks? nuclear physics? the standard model of particle physics? These are all models within the currently acceptable theories (frameworks) of 4, 5, and 6 above. Numbers 1 and 2? They’ve been replaced!\n\n\n8.1.3 Laziness: Belief\nOne more word that both has no place in science but is one of those words we use all the time: Belief. We all talk about what we believe (and don’t), and scientists will sometimes colloquially do that in a scientific context, but that’s sloppy. When I say “I believe in X,” what I really mean is that that job that word does is act as a shorthand for the sentence: “X is highly confirmed by experiments and X is likely to survive foreseeable experimental tests if asked.” If I’m an expert in the field of X, then I have the obligation to describe those experimental tests. If I’m not an expert in X and I want to echo an expert’s “belief,” I should expect that expert could also enumerate its experimental successes in detail on my behalf. (That’s a little tricky.)\nThere are dos and don’ts here for scientists (and students of science). When it comes to belief in a scientific statement, I can’t do three things:\n\nI can’t say that I believe in X because I want to,\nI can’t say that I believe in X because my gut or a “feeling” suggests that I should, and\nI can’t say that I believe in X because just because a non-expert or an authoritative text tells me to. Likewise, I can’t say that I don’t believe in X for any of those same three reasons"

    "section": "1 The speed of light",
    "text": "1 The speed of light\nIn QS&BB we’ll spend a lot of effort becoming comfortable with Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. One of its famous, bedrock rules is that the speed of light is the fastest that anything can travel. (BTW, for Einstein that was technically a “postulate,” not a law.) Relativity has been confirmed so many times that we use it as a tool and not a theory to be tested…Florida should call it the Law of Relativity. But we don’t. It’s the Theory of Relativity.\nThere is an elementary particle called the neutrino that is so light that it travels at almost the speed of light. In 2011 an experiment called OPERA (Oscillation Project with Emulsion-tracking Apparatus) in a mountain in the middle of Italy was under way to measure properties of neutrinos coming from the CERN particle accelerator in Geneva, Switzerland, almost 500 miles away.\n\n\n\nThe Gran Sasso Lab near Rome is not near Geneva!\n\n\n\n1.1 The experiment\nThe neutrinos are received after they’ve traveled 730 km from CERN, through a cord of the Earth. The laboratory in Italy is inside of a large mountain about 1400 meters high.\n\n\n\nNeutrinos were produced at the CERN lab slightly underground; they passed through a chord of the Earth for more than 700 meters and (sometimes) interacted in the OPERA detector inside of the Gran Sasso mountain.\n\n\nThe experiment was designed to measure neutrino oscillations,1 a project done in multiple locations around the globe. But the scientists realized that they could make a measurement of the velocity of neutrinos very precisely. They made sure that they understood the distance from the source at CERN to the experiment (their “Geodesy campaign” determined that they knew the 730 km distance to a precision of 20 centimeters! This includes any geological movement of the crust. There was an earthquake in 2009 and the measurements of the crust movement were published.) and with a precise determination of when the neutrinos left CERN and when they arrived in Italy, the velocity could be measured.\nTo do that, OPERA had a sophisticated GPS system that measured times in Geneva and times in the mountain at a precision better than ±0.000000010 seconds (\\(\\pm10\\) nanoseconds). The figure shows the GPS satellite communication with CERN and then to the top of the Gran Sasso mountain…and then down through the mountain almost 8000 meters to the electronics of the OPERA experiment.\nWhat they found was that the neutrinos appeared to arrive faster than the speed of light would allow, apparently violating the Theory of Relativity! How much faster?\n\\[\nv(\\text{neutrinos})- c = 60.7 \\pm 10 \\text{ nanoseconds}\n\\]\nThey seemed to be traveling at 1.0000248 times the speed of light! Special Relativity cannot abide this. What do you do?\n\n1.1.1 Law of relativity?\nIf Relativity were a Law of Nature in the Florida-way (laws) – say the “Law of Relativity” – then the surprising OPERA measurement would have confronted the authority of that Law of Relativity and the scientists would back down – can’t cross that threshold of Law. But OPERA scientists couldn’t do that. The experimenters worked very hard to redo their analyses and scoured their experimental apparatus for any place that the few nanoseconds might have been missing.\nI was a member of the Physics Advisory Committee at the Fermi National Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois which was running a similar experiment, shooting neutrinos from Illinois to a mine in northern Minnesota. We asked them and learned that they too saw an effect, but they used a conventional GPS system and they couldn’t measure times precisely enough to test OPERA… so we bought them a fancy – expensive – GPS system so they could check! Meanwhile many alternative explanations around Relativity were proposed to account for the measurement. Many, many. A small theoretical physics industry of alternative ideas.\nLook at the figure of the Earth’s surface above…notice that the signal from the satellite lands on the top of the Italian mountain, and then nearly 8000 meters of cable runs down and around and through the laboratory. After a year or so, OPERA discovered a subtle, tiny, but flawed optical fiber seating that accounted for the missing few nanoseconds and then were able to conclude that Einstein could rest easy. Meanwhile, Fermilab had a shiny, new GPS system.\nWhat did they say?\n\n“This result comes as a complete surprise,” said OPERA spokesperson, Antonio Ereditato of the University of Bern. “After many months of studies and cross checks we have not found any instrumental eﬀect that could explain the result of the measurement. While OPERA researchers will continue their studies, we are also looking forward to independent measurements to fully assess the nature of this observation.”2\n\nAnd from CERN, who supplied the beam and of course were the source of some of the timing measurements:\n\n“When an experiment finds an apparently unbelievable result and can find no artefact of the measurement to account for it, it’s normal procedure to invite broader scrutiny, and this is exactly what the OPERA collaboration is doing, it’s good scientific practice,” said CERN Research Director Sergio Bertolucci. “If this measurement is confirmed, it might change our view of physics, but we need to be sure that there are no other, more mundane, explanations. That will require independent measurements.”3\n\nYou get the important part of this story? Relativity is among the most trusted theories in all of science — if anything could be labeled as “Law” then this is it! And yet, when faced with an apparent problem, we had to dig deeper.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n📝 The authority of Relativity is not absolute, it’s not Law-like, but a highly trusted theory.\n\n\nNow, many in my community were very hard on the OPERA scientists, which I think was unfair. They measured something unusual, tried to kill that unusual result, could not, and so published it. I was at the original announcement at a CERN colloquium. It was straightforward. The last slide in the presentation said, “We do not attempt any theoretical or phenomenological interpretation of the results…We are not in a hurry. We are saying, tell us what we did wrong, redo the measurement if you can.”\nHere’s the abstract from the original paper, Measurement of the neutrino velocity with the OPERA detector in the CNGS beam:\n\nThe OPERA neutrino experiment at the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory has measured the velocity of neutrinos from the CERN CNGS beam over a baseline of about 730 km with much higher accuracy than previous studies conducted with accelerator neutrinos. The measurement is based on high-statistics data taken by OPERA in the years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Dedicated upgrades of the CNGS timing system and of the OPERA detector, as well as a high precision geodesy campaign for the measurement of the neutrino baseline, allowed reaching comparable systematic and statistical accuracies. An early arrival time of CNGS muon neutrinos with respect to the one computed assuming the speed of light in vacuum of (60.7 ± 6.9 (stat.) ± 7.4 (sys.)) ns was measured. This anomaly corresponds to a relative difference of the muon neutrino velocity with respect to the speed of light(v-c)/c = (2.48 ± 0.28 (stat.) ± 0.30 (sys.))×10-5.5\n\nNothing breathless. Nothing grandiose. Just the facts. The experimenters did nothing wrong. Their analysis was proper. Their use of timing was proper, but unfortunately for them, there was a really hidden single point of failure in the timing circuit that led to an unaccounted for 60 nanoseconds of delay.\nI was proud of my community during that episode. That’s how it’s supposed to work. There are no Laws of the capital L kind."

    "section": "2 Some technical details (in words)",
    "text": "2 Some technical details (in words)\n\n2.1 The beam\nHow accelerators produce neutrino beams varies according to capabilities, scientific need, and strategy. Beams are electrostatically and magnetically removed from the primary proton accelerator at a regular rate, related to the fact that the protons in the primary beam are bunched in small packets. The protons are sent to a target which produces unstable particles (pions) which decay in a long, evacuated pipe into neutrinos which then travel to the distant detector.\nThe time determination was not on an event by event basis, but a statistical one. In the original measurement the Super Proton Synchrotron delivered protons to the target in a “continuous” distribution which was 10 microseconds wide separated from one another by 50 milliseconds. Notice that the anomalous measurement was different by 60 nanoseconds. Within that broad distribution of protons’ times when they created neutrinos, there were five peaks separated by 5 nanoseconds (corresponding to the accelerator’s 200 MHz radiofrequency structure. Any proton in that long bunch could produce an interaction in the detector in a broad time window, relative to the difference measured.\nThe accumulated time stamps of each event were packaged into a probability distribution and shaped-wise compared with the known shape of the accelerator’s proton distribution. The analysis of the results was done blindly – meaning that crucial parameters were hidden from the scientists (with one or two holding the key). When all of the timing and geodesy calibrations were done, then the unblinding was done so that actual times were for the first time revealed. The result must have terrified people. Either they had overturned Relativity or they had a long project ahead of them to understand it.\n\n\n2.2 The followup\nTheoretical physicists got to work. Within a year, almost 200 theory papers were published explaining the faster-than-light neutrino within new models beyond Relativity. The stakes were high and a new beam was produced by CERN which greatly narrowed that broad proton timing distribution – in essence, beating the frequency of the drum of neutrino production faster and more precisely. Another experiment at CERN (ICARUS) was running and could make a comparable measurement. As I noted the Fermilab experiment which first had broad timing distributions made measurements with their new GPS system. Everything fell in line: Relativity was still not disconfirmed."

I earned my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Iowa State University in 1972. After a year in industry, I returned to academia, completing an M.S. in Physics and the Philosophy of Science at Northern Illinois University and a Ph.D. in Physics at Carnegie-Mellon University in 1980. Following two years as a postdoctoral researcher at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, I joined the MSU Department of Physics and Astronomy in 1982, and in 2011, I was honored as a University Distinguished Professor.\nAs Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy from 1994 to 2001, I oversaw the construction of a new department building, facilitated MSU’s involvement in the construction of the SOAR 4m telescope in Chile, and integrated the private Abrams Planetarium into the department. After stepping down as Chair in 2001, I returned to full-time research and teaching in particle physics.\nIn the 1980s, I served as spokesperson for Fermilab’s neutrino experiment E733 and have been a member of the Fermilab D0 collaboration since its early days. I’ve taken on leadership roles in significant measurements and the development of D0 apparatus components, including chairing the experiment’s Computing Policy Board and assembling an early grid Linux farm that generated 1 billion Monte Carlo events in the late 1990s.\nI am also a member of MSU’s LHC ATLAS group, where I was the first convenor of the Single Top Group and led the “Phase 0” “CMX” trigger electronics upgrade for the L1Calo system. Together with a colleague from the University of Michigan, I conceived and continue to direct the ATLAS “Tier 2” data center, funded through competitive awards.\nIn 2010, I served as Chair of the APS Division of Particles and Fields. Over the years, I’ve been a member of the DOE High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP), the United States representative to the International Committee on Future Accelerators (ICFA), and served two terms on the Fermilab Physics Advisory Committee. I’ve also been a member of the Fermilab Research Alliance Board of Directors, the United States ATLAS Institutional Board Chair for two years, and co-convened the DPF Snowmass 2013 Energy Frontier study, which covered all aspects of particle physics.\nThroughout my career, I’ve taught across the undergraduate and graduate curricula, and in recent years, I’ve focused on teaching general education students. I developed two unique courses for non-science majors: one that intertwines the history of physics with the history of art and another exploring elementary particle physics and cosmology.\nI’ve authored or co-authored over 1,000 publications in experimental and phenomenological particle physics and have been continuously funded by the National Science Foundation since 1982. I’m a Fellow of the American Physical Society and have received two all-university awards from MSU for research and teaching.\nOutside of physics, I’m a lifelong baseball fan and have spent many years coaching high school baseball in East Lansing.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

While we physicists have a pretty good sense of what constitutes good science, we don’t have a rulebook and we can sometimes argue about this among ourselves.\nThere’s an element of “if it works, it’s okay.” But also some taboos.\nSince I’ll be talking about old and new ideas, I thought I should try to put down my views on NOS from my physics-perspective. Below is a sketch to be fleshed out in separate posts with links below.\n\n\nI think that the term scientific “Law” is misleading because it implies a fancy 🎓 permanence and universality, running counter to the fact that science is contingent. It originated with Isaac Newton’s deciphering of what appeared to be the absolute rules of the Universe. His explanations convinced people that the world was knowable – no small part of the basis of the Enlightenment. So science revealed Laws, capital “L.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mystic William Blake, painted his Newton (1795–c.1805, William Blake) as a negative image. Blake was distinctly unhappy with what he thought was a sterile and godless turn in European thought. But that he chose this subject as a vehicle for his annimosity toward the Enlightenment is…, well, enlightening.\n\n\nBut we don’t do Law any more. We do theories and models – at least I do 😎. That’s because the distinction between a Law of physics and a theory of physics is often often misunderstood. (See in the menu bar ☝️ my gripe in just a theory? .) For now, if I mention an old-historical “law” (“Newton’s law”) I’ll use lower case. Otherwise, it’s theories…all the way down.\n\n\n\nI think that the common idea about a theory is that it is a set of guesses or hunches. We all do it: have a theory as to why that tree fell down (“It was leaning and it was really windy.”)\nThis everyday sense leads to the a mistaken notion that theories are somehow less than laws. Since I’ve aleready set aside “laws” as unhelpful, let me try to explain what my notion of theories are.\nA scientific theory is a framework that can have three jobs:\n\nExplain observed phenomena.\nTie together ideas that once seemed unrelated.\nPredict new phenomena – while being consistent with previously successes. (Ask Mr Google about Immanuel Velikovsky and Venus.)\n\nWe usually emphasize #3, but I think that #1 is underappreciated. Can an acceptable theory only explain even if it doesn’t yet predict novel phenomena? (See “arguing among ourselves” in the first paragraph.)\nTextbooks often define a scientific theory as a systematic explanation facts. But what counts as an explanation? A paragraph? A logical set of proofs? A set of mathematical equations? A nicely formed tweet?\nMy problem is distinguishing something as all encompassing as Quantum Theory from the theory of atoms. The latter is a part of the former since we describe atoms using the tools and commitments of Quantum Theory.\nHere’s my take:\nA framework – made of logical statements and/or mathematics – provides tools and guidance on how to use them. Furthermore – and this is important – a theory limits itself to a domain: For example, A theory of chemical bonding doesn’t need to encompass the theory of black holes. Its “domain” is atoms and molecules. Engineers bulding bridges use Newton’s (“laws of” we say) mechanics, but their domain doesn’t encompass the theory of evolution. But there are overlaps: the theory of chemical bonding must embrace the rules of the quantum theory, so there is a heirarchy among theories.\nTwo important aspects of this complicated mix.\n\nOur trust in theories is earned. Quantum mechanics is highly trusted (not sacred, so not Law-like) It might be a part of a grander theory.\nWe can’t use or test a theory directly. Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity consists of two short English (well, German) sentences in the form of postuates. That’s the framework idea. Testing and using them requires building models..\n\nWe’re guided bytheories, but we test models. In physics, those models are mathematical.\n\n\n\nWhen we make mathematical [model]s, they are very specific. First they consist of inputs, Let’s call them (x, y, z), where the variables could be numerical facts or procedural commitments or other inputs. Then, a model has some calculational, ✏️ , process. An algorithm if you will that tests an idea. Maybe you remember “turning the crank” in a school cacluation.\nThat model has an…urgency. Start it going (calculating) and a conclusion, 📈 , is the result. So in cartoon form:\n” [(x, y, z) → ✏️ ] will result in: 📈 .”\nWhat comes out after “turning the crank” is 📈: a function, a number, a plot, an expected state of matter. This a theory cannot do.\nThe result, 📈, can refer to something previously known (an explanation) or to something to be tested (a prediction). The whole process, [model + successful explanation] or [model + prediction + successful measurement] I’ll call a scientific process.\n\n\n\nScientific knowledge is a bit special. It’s easy for us in everyday life to spontaneously decide that we “know” something – until we learn that we were were wrong! And that’s not a problem, it happens.\nBut scientific knowledge is different and we expect a lot from it. It’s not a ’belief” which is personal and often unjustifiable. In fact, while it sounds scientific, “I believe in evolution” is not a scientific statement. Just like “I believe in martians” isn’t. Belief is not justified in scientific language.\nOne of the jobs of a scientific statement is to assert something that’s checkable. It must be public, based on expertise, always open to scrutiny, and within the norms of the scientific community (admitedly, a tough thing to define). What’s important is that scientific statements are made and trusted by experts. Unfortunately, folks with expertise are sometimes now called “elites,” as if expertise is bad.\nScientific statements are the grammar used to test the claims of models against experiment. They can take the form of sentences, a mathematical function, the prediction of a state of matter, or a numerical fact. Interpreting them can, however, be nuanced.\nIf my scientific statement ( 📈 ) does not agree with the results of an experiment, I would have to say that my statement is disconfirmed (not “disproven”). If it repeatedly doesn’t match, that result casts doubt on the model but more likely on the inputs to the model.\n\n\nWhen the results of a measurement appears to agree with the model’s prediction, then we say that the model is confirmed. But that’s nuanced in a variety of ways.\n\nFirst, the domain may be so broad as to be unhelpful as a scientific statement. That Winston-Salem is between Detroit and Miami could be confirmed but it’s not very precise.\nSecond, it’s possible for a scientific statement to agree with experiment, but accidentally. When I say it’s 2 pm and it is 2 pm, but my watch stopped at 2 am, that’s not a helpful scientific conclusion. Justification is required of a confirmed scientific statement.\nFinally, and this is both important and not understood outside of the scientifi community is uncertainty. If the results of a political poll say that candidate X polls at 49% and candidate Y polls at 51% and that the margin of uncertainty is 5%, then those candidates are tied. Y is not ahead of X. In political polling these are statements about the statistical precision of the measurement, but in scientific prediction and measurement there are other uncertainties in play. The inputs (x, y, z) are certainly imprecise and that uncertainty will be carried through to the results of the model. And, the model’s algorithm might have its own uncertainties. The end result is that if I were to say that my scientific statement is 2 feet, that’s not scientific. If you used a yardstick without any markings to make your measurement, then your ability to be as precise as one foot is nil. If you used a micrometer to make your measurement, then your determination of “2” might be very precise, but it would still have uncertainty. The scientifically proper way to report the model’s prediction and/or the experiment’s result is \\(2\\pm a\\) feet where \\(a\\) is the uncertainty, like \\(2 \\pm 0.1\\) feet.\n\nThis means that no prediction and no measurement is absolutely precise. And so one cannot prove a result, not a model and certainly not a theory. So, following on that and using the term in its normal way, there is no measureable truth in a scientific process."

    "text": "3 Scientific Knowledge, Proof, and Truth\nScientific knowledge is a bit special. It’s easy for us in everyday life to spontaneously decide that we “know” something – until we learn that we were were wrong! And that’s not a problem, it happens.\nBut scientific knowledge is different and we expect a lot from it. It’s not a ’belief” which is personal and often unjustifiable. In fact, while it sounds scientific, “I believe in evolution” is not a scientific statement. Belief is not justifiable in scientific language.\nThe grammar of scientific knowledge is scientific statements.\n\n3.1 Scientific statements\nA scientific statement is not casual talk. It’s an assertion of something that’s checkable and it’s either what a model generates or how a scientific process is later described for the public. In both cases it’s open to scrutiny, and speaks a language that is within the norms of the scientific community (admitedly, a tough thing to define).\nWhatever comes out of a model’s crank-turning is a scientific statement in a form that can be compared with an experiment: they can be sentences, a mathematical function, the prediction of a state of matter, or a numerical fact.\nThat’s sort of an active job, but it can also do the work of reporting on results and there it has similar requirements. To say that “The value of the Newtonian constant of gravitation is \\(6.674 30 \\times 10^{-11}\\) m\\(^3\\) kg\\(^{-1}\\) s\\(^{-2}\\).” is not a scientfic statement. Rather, The value of the Newtonian constant of gravitation is \\(6.674 30 \\times 10^{-11} \\pm 0.00015\\) m\\(^3\\) kg\\(^{-1}\\) s\\(^{-2}\\).” is a scientific statement. You see, higher standards.\nIf my scientific statement as a model’s output does not agree with the results of an experiment, I would have to say that my statement is disconfirmed (not “disproven”). If it repeatedly doesn’t match, that result casts doubt on either the model or the inputs to the model.\n\n\n3.2 Proof?\nWhen the results of a measurement appears to agree with the model’s prediction, then we say that the model is confirmed. But not proven.\nThat’s because no prediction and no measurement is absolutely precise. And so one cannot prove a result, not a model and certainly not a theory. One learns – and the scientific community learns – a measure of trust for some statements, theories, and models. Some are highly trusted, some less so. We highly trust Einstein’s Special Relativity, but it’s not indubitable. See my story of Opera in\nSo, following on that and using the term in its normal way, there is no measureable truth in a scientific process. Scientists will sometimes be loose with language about this…“getting near the truth” or ” X is probably a part of the truth” might come out of their mouths, but we all know the limitations.\nHere’s more detail: 3.00 knowledge, proof, and truth"
