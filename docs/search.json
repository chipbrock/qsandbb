I earned my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Iowa State University in 1972. After a year in industry, I returned to academia, completing an M.S. in Physics and the Philosophy of Science at Northern Illinois University and a Ph.D. in Physics at Carnegie-Mellon University in 1980. Following two years as a postdoctoral researcher at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, I joined the MSU Department of Physics and Astronomy in 1982, and in 2011, I was honored as a University Distinguished Professor.\nAs Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy from 1994 to 2001, I oversaw the construction of a new department building, facilitated MSU’s involvement in the construction of the SOAR 4m telescope in Chile, and integrated the private Abrams Planetarium into the department. After stepping down as Chair in 2001, I returned to full-time research and teaching in particle physics.\nIn the 1980s, I served as spokesperson for Fermilab’s neutrino experiment E733 and have been a member of the Fermilab D0 collaboration since its early days. I’ve taken on leadership roles in significant measurements and the development of D0 apparatus components, including chairing the experiment’s Computing Policy Board and assembling an early grid Linux farm that generated 1 billion Monte Carlo events in the late 1990s.\nI am also a member of MSU’s LHC ATLAS group, where I was the first convenor of the Single Top Group and led the “Phase 0” “CMX” trigger electronics upgrade for the L1Calo system. Together with a colleague from the University of Michigan, I conceived and continue to direct the ATLAS “Tier 2” data center, funded through competitive awards.\nIn 2010, I served as Chair of the APS Division of Particles and Fields. Over the years, I’ve been a member of the DOE High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP), the United States representative to the International Committee on Future Accelerators (ICFA), and served two terms on the Fermilab Physics Advisory Committee. I’ve also been a member of the Fermilab Research Alliance Board of Directors, the United States ATLAS Institutional Board Chair for two years, and co-convened the DPF Snowmass 2013 Energy Frontier study, which covered all aspects of particle physics.\nThroughout my career, I’ve taught across the undergraduate and graduate curricula, and in recent years, I’ve focused on teaching general education students. I developed two unique courses for non-science majors: one that intertwines the history of physics with the history of art and another exploring elementary particle physics and cosmology.\nI’ve authored or co-authored over 1,000 publications in experimental and phenomenological particle physics and have been continuously funded by the National Science Foundation since 1982. I’m a Fellow of the American Physical Society and have received two all-university awards from MSU for research and teaching.\nOutside of physics, I’m a lifelong baseball fan and have spent many years coaching high school baseball in East Lansing.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "1 It is not possible to test a theory. We test models.\nI’ve discarded Laws and truth and proof and so it’s time to confront the idea of a theory and how we can trust one or not. “What is a theory,” is a valid question.\n\n1.1 Planes, Trains, and Automobiles: Models\nWhen I was a kid, I was consumed by models of cars— “hot rods” of the 1960s. And airplanes. And HO train sets. In short, life-like replicas of transportation tools were my passion when I wasn’t playing or watching baseball.\nA plastic model stands for—represents—a real thing in the world, not perfectly, but well enough to complete a mission. In my case, that mission was a 13 year old boy imagining the car that he’d work on and own some day. If my plastic 1967 Chevy with baby moon wheels, GM 350 cubes with aluminum heads, Edelbrock intake manifold, Holley 4bbl, HPC Coated Headers w/Dual Exhaust, painted baby blue was made more and more precise, it would eventually become…a real car.\nchevybox.png intage Revell model ’57 Chevy. In the box.\nI’ve been careful in what I wrote in other posts to do two things. First, I referred to scientific statements and models of nature. Gone are the days when a physicist can construct a mathematical description of say a block of wood sliding down a plane of wood and proudly proclaim that what’s written in symbols on paper is a 1:1 faithful reproduction of what happens in the laboratory.\nNow we operate from a more hazy, removed vantage point. As we consider electric and magnetic fields, relativity, and quantum mechanics the correspondence between a mathematical description and what nature is supposed to be like will become necessarily more indirect and abstract.\nI now tend to think of a theory as a broad framework within which there are many ways to address nature from within the framework. But what we don’t do is test the theory, rather we build mathematical models that use the rules (from within the framework) of a theory to address a particular, well-defined piece of nature with predictions. Then experiments are done to test the model, not the theory.\nLet’s pick on Special Relativity again. I can tell you the Theory of Relativity in these three lines:\n\nThe rules of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe interval between two spacetime events is Minkowskian.\n\nThe first two statements are called the Postulates of Relativity and the last statement is a consequence of the mathematization of the theory in geometry.\nThis is the Theory of Relativity…the framework within which any scientific statement must fit. You don’t need to understand what these sentences mean, but you can surely see that they don’t contain a single mathematic equation. That’s where the models come in.\nIn my way of thinking, a mathematical model of nature is a little machine that you run to a result at the end when you add some information at the beginning. The result can be, and usually is, the prediction of what an experiment would find. That result can also be another equation, distilled from input equations.\nWe will use the Theory of Relativity quite a bit, but our confrontation with nature will be through models that are built within the framework of the Theory of Relativity.\nAn important aspect of a model is that it must respect a possible measurement’s capabilities. A model is not meant to be a 1:1 representation of nature, just like the model car is not a real car. It’s a limited representation that can be tested. Here’s what I mean.\nI can create a model for how fast a block will move across a table if it’s pushed with a given force. If that’s all I want to know, that’s a pretty easy thing to predict. But notice that it’s not the whole story of what goes on. The table and the block heat up and so energy is lost to the warming air. There are billions of little, complex atomic bonds between the under-surface of the block and the table-top. There’s a lot of physics involved in describing this event and how much detail I include in the model depends on a) what I want to know from my measurement and b) how well I need to know it. My model could include all of those thermodynamic and atomic effects but I wouldn’t include them if I can’t measure the speed very precisely.\nPhysicists learn to stick to the Goldilocks Rule of Modeling. A model can’t be too crude and a model can’t be too precise…a model needs to be Just Right.\nTo summarize:\n\naccept a theory and its rules; build mathematical models within the theory to represent nature (but not in a 1:1 sense);\nmake predictions from those models and test them in experiments;\naccept or reject the model based on the results of the experiments.\n\nThat’s the game that I’ve played for four decades in which I’ve never left the theory of quantum mechanics, the theory of special relativity, nor the theory of general relativity…but I’ve tested lots of models.\n\n1.1.1 Statements\nIt’s a detail, but an important one. We cannot test nature directly. We can only assess the truth or falsity only of statements. This reflects a remoteness of a scientist relative to nature itself. So a prediction and a test of that prediction is really testing statements and not theories and not nature. I confess this is hard to appreciate and I can probably argue even with myself about it.\npainting.png In some ways, what an artist does when she paints a landscape is make a model of it. Representation theory is a serious part of “Semiotics” which is a sophisticated discipline in philosophy, linguistics, and aesthetics.\n\n\n\n1.2 Memory Medicine: Confirmation and Disconfirmation\nIn my car I just heard an advertisement for a supplement that would make me remember things better. (I don’t remember its name…see what I did there?) It apparently has been “proven” to be effective. Well, by now you know my problems with that word, but what is it that scientists can actually say about a model and indirectly, the theory framework within which it functions?\nThe black squirrel issue makes it clear that proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that an inductive model is true is risky and historically unproductive.\n\nThe word that we use when evidence supports a model’s prediction is “confirm”…the model’s prediction is confirmed, definately not “proved.”\nThe word we use when a model’s prediction is contradicted is “disconfirmed.”\nThe burden of any model is that it must be “falsifiable” or in principle be disconfirmable.\n\nA couple of notes. “Confirm” is weaker than prove, leaving us the necessary freedom to allow that evidence can change our models and even theories. Those theories that I keep saying we trust? They have been confirmed many, many times. (It’s fair to think that maybe a Law is just a really, well-confirmed theory. But I’m fighting that older picture of Newtonian-like Laws.)\nThat last bullet is important and has a special place in the Philosophy of Science—and is the center of a couple of serious arguments in my fields of physics right now.\n\nYou might have heard some of this in the news and the falsifiability test of a theory (the word used then) is attributed to the philosopher, Karl Popper. He thought this was a worthy goal of science because showing something to be wrong is actually a deductive process, the inverse of showing that something agrees.\n\nTo a Popperian (my pejorative word) a single instance of disconfirmation should eliminate a model from study (they would say “theory”). A single black squirrel? That’s nice sounding, but not how science actually works and is philosophically troublesome (ask Mr Google about the Duhem–Quine thesis)–that black squirrel could have just been in a dust-bin.\n\nThe requirement of falsifiability as a standard required of science has pretty much stuck with us.\n\nCan you see how this in-principle falsifiability requirement actually feeds my original assertion above about how to tell if a statement is scientific or not? The latter is just a simpler version of the former.\nThe bottom line here is this:\n\nThe burden on science is not to prove things about nature, but to confirm or disconfirm statements about nature.\n\nIn QS&BB, we’ll watch revolutions in science that create large frameworks in which models are tested, rejected, and accepted. These frameworks I will call theories and I can list them for you:\n\nNewton’s laws of motion (remember?)\nNewton’s law of Gravitation\nMaxwell’s Theory of Electromagnetism\nQuantum Mechanics\nSpecial Relativity Theory\nThe General Theory of Relativity\n\nIn my picture, there are not many theories in physics.\nOther topics like the big bang? quarks? nuclear physics? the standard model of particle physics? These are all models within the currently acceptable theories (frameworks) of 4, 5, and 6 above. Numbers 1 and 2? They’ve been replaced!\n\n\n1.3 Laziness: Belief\nOne more word that both has no place in science but is one of those words we use all the time: Belief. We all talk about what we believe (and don’t), and scientists will sometimes colloquially do that in a scientific context, but that’s sloppy. When I say “I believe in X,” what I really mean is that that job that word does is act as a shorthand for the sentence: “X is highly confirmed by experiments and X is likely to survive foreseeable experimental tests if asked.” If I’m an expert in the field of X, then I have the obligation to describe those experimental tests. If I’m not an expert in X and I want to echo an expert’s “belief,” I should expect that expert could also enumerate its experimental successes in detail on my behalf. (That’s a little tricky.)\nThere are dos and don’ts here for scientists (and students of science). When it comes to belief in a scientific statement, I can’t do three things:\n\nI can’t say that I believe in X because I want to,\nI can’t say that I believe in X because my gut or a “feeling” suggests that I should, and\nI can’t say that I believe in X because just because a non-expert or an authoritative text tells me to. Likewise, I can’t say that I don’t believe in X for any of those same three reasons\n\n\n\n👈 Previous: 4.00 proof | Next: 6.00 reality 👉"

    "text": "2.1 How they differ from everyday knowledge\nFirst of all, everyday knowledge production doesn’t adhere to strict rules, so that’s an obvious difference with scientific knowledge. Rules-based knowledge that’s not science is probably the Law. What you say, how you say it, and how you justify it is pretty much the whole game for the legal profession.\n👉 For me, I think that #5 above is key. It removes “proof” and “truth” from the game since everything you assert must come with an uncertainty. There’s no analog to this in everyday knowledge production and consumption. In fact, polemic everyday knowledge is usually, aggressively certain.\n\n\n👈 Previous: 1.00 laws | Next: 3.00 truth 👉"

    "text": "1.1 Laws?\nThe popular notion of a Scientific Law is a statement that’s impossible to dispute: once it’s discovered, it’s almost biblical in its permanence. Once you’ve found a Law, man, you’re done. That’s it. That Law is way better than a theory. Go do something else.\nThis “Law” was incorporated into the description of physics following Isaac Newton’s almost super-human successes. Surely, he’d uncovered the God-given Laws of Nature and surely uncovering the Laws of Nature is now the goal of science. You’ll see all manner of “Laws” that follow Newton’s three Laws of Motion and Newton’s Gravitational Law: Snell’s Law, The First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics, the Law of Reflection, Faraday’s Law, Ampere’s Law…and so on, up to the 20th century when we got serious.\nFrom that point, it’s Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity, Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, Quantum Theory, Ginzburg–Landau Theory, Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Theory, Relativistic Quantum Field Theory, Inflation Theory, the Big Bang Theory, and so on. Are we just dumber than when all of science was uncovering Laws? No. Rather, around the turn of the 20th century the subtlety of science is was sinking in. But apparently not in Florida. onlytheory\nLet me tell you a story.\nThe speed of light\nWe’ll spend a lot of effort becoming comfortable with Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. One of its famous, bedrock rules is that the speed of light is the fastest that anything can travel. (BTW, that’s technically a “postulate,” not a law.) Relativity has been confirmed so many times that we use it as a tool and not a theory to be tested…Florida should call it the Law of Relativity. But we don’t. It’s the Theory of Relativity.\n\nThere is an elementary particle called the neutrino that is so light that it travels at almost the speed of light. In 2011 an experiment called Opera in a mountain in northern Italy was under way to measure properties of neutrinos coming from the CERN particle accelerator in Geneva, Switzerland, almost 1000 km away.\nIn order to be sure of the source of interactions, Opera had a sophisticated GPS system that measured times in Geneva and times in the mountain at a precision better than ±0.000000010 seconds (±10 nanoseconds). What they found was that the neutrinos appeared to arrive faster than the speed of light would allow, apparently violating the Theory of Relativity!\nIf Relativity were a Law of Nature in the Florida-way, say the “Law of Relativity”—then the surprising Opera measurement would have confronted the authority of the Law of Relativity and the scientists would back down: can’t cross that threshold of Law. But Opera scientists couldn’t do that. The experimenters worked very hard to redo their analyses and scoured their experimental apparatus for any place that the few nanoseconds might have been missing.\nI was a member of the Physics Advisory Committee at the Fermi National Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois which was running a similar experiment, shooting neutrinos from Illinois to a mine in northern Minnesota. We asked them and learned that they too saw an effect, but they used a conventional GPS and they couldn’t measure times precisely enough to test Opera… so we bought them a fancy – expensive – GPS system so they could check! Meanwhile many alternative explanations around Relativity were proposed to account for the measurement. Many, many. A small theoretical physics industry of alternative ideas.\nAfter a year or so, Opera discovered a subtle, tiny, but flawed optical fiber seating that accounted for the missing few nanoseconds and then were able to conclude that Einstein could rest easy. Meanwhile, Fermilab had a shiny, new GPS system.\n\nYou get the important part of this story? Relativity is among the most trusted theories in all of science — if anything could be labeled as “Law” then this is it! And yet, when faced with an apparent problem, we had to dig deeper.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n📝 The authority of Relativity is not absolute, it’s not Law-like, but a highly trusted theory.\n\n\nI was proud of my community during that episode. That’s how it’s supposed to work. There are no Laws of the capital L kind."

    "text": "1.2 My criterion for a proper scientific statement\nI’m treading into waters that force us to think about what is and what isn’t a proper scientific process. Historically. that’s the problem of demarcating Scientific Knowledge from “Pseudoscientific Science.” You may have heard that scientific statements must be “falsifiable,” an idea often credited to the philosopher of science (and other things), Karl Popper3\nHere’s my personal rule:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n🫵 In order for you to assert a statement about the natural world as legitimately scientific, you must be able to say what it would take to change your mind.\n\n\n\nNobody said, “Let’s ignore this evidence because Relativity must be true.” We all said, “Wow. This is probably a mistake but we’d better spend a year around the world checking it.”\n\n👍 Proponents of scientific statements can always tell you what evidence would force them to abandon one of their favorite theories, here, a superluminal particle qualifies as one of those pieces of evidence that could in-principle have overthrown Relativity.\n👎 Proponents of unscientific statements cannot – or will not – do that. The most obvious contemporary example of unscientific assertions are those that come from creationism or “intelligent design.” Unlike the Opera experience, proponents of these systems of belief hold that some parts of their knowledge live in territory that is off-limits for questioning.\n\nWait. Why shouldn’t students be taught both sides of such a disagreement about our origins?\nGlad you asked. That’s now called “teach the controversy“ and it’s not appropriate in a science class for two reasons. First, to put creationism in a science class goes against that crucial falsifiability requirement. So it’s not science. Second, science is not a democracy. There’s no requirement in how the universe works that it make people happy. It is what it is.\n\nIf you believe that “X” cannot be doubted? Then X may be some form of knowledge, but it’s not scientific knowledge.\n\nWait. What about Newtonian Gravitation! It’s used today even to determine satellite and spacecraft trajectories.  Glad you asked. A tiny bit of display math can answer that I hope\n\nHere is Newton’s Gravitational law (see what I did there? law not Law):\n\\[F = G\\frac{M_1M_2}{R_{12}}\\]\nIn words, this formula says that the force of gravitational attraction between two objects that have masses of \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\) and whose centers are separated by the distance \\(R_{12}\\) is that relationship. Let’s look at each piece:\n\n\\(G\\) is called the gravitational constant (or Newton’s constant). It’s very hard to measure and as a resut it’s the worst measured constant of nature of all. A question of scientific research today.\n\\(M\\) is the mass…which is a very complicated concept. As we speake, we are at work at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland trying to understand mass. A question of scientific research today.\n\\(R^2\\) …that “2” in the formula is a direct consequence of the presumption that we have three dimensions of space. It’s a measurable quantity – and is not very precisely determined and the notion that we have three and not more spacial dimensions is a question of scientific research today.\n\nSo every term in Newton’s Gravatation law is uncertain and theoretically of interest. Again, Laws shouldn’t do that.\n\nWait. So, what can you believe in?  Glad you asked. That’s an understandable concern for folks who don’t do science for a living. We have theories and they are all questionable. We must live in a world that is full of uncertainty and a scientific world where no idea is permanent. I suspect that’s uncomfortable for many but it’s our lives.\n\nSo “theories all the way down” really means that we have a few theories that we trust very well and we don’t question them now unless a surprise happens. And we have many theories that are not trusted as much. So not turtles all the way down, but theories of varying degrees of trustworthiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n📝 In QS&BB we’ll work with the nuts and bolts of science: theories and models and this site will consist of the stories of how theories came to be, how they were modified, how they disappeared, and how we know so much more about the universe as a result.\n\n\n\n\nNext: 2.00 knowledge 👉"

But while we use normal words in real life, some of them are different in scientific life.\nAs for the crying? Years ago I was triggered by a long argument in the state of Florida.\nAround 2008 the Florida State Board of Education was grappling with their “F” grade in a national review of science education. And, predictably instructions to teachers on how to teach evolution was a major issue. A few states insisted on teaching creationism, or the cloak-and-dagger idea of “Intelligent Design,” along side of, or in place of actual science.\nSo after many, many hearings, reports, testimony from Nobel laureats, and very public disputes, The fuss was resolved by mandating that whenever evolution was mentioned, it was to be referred to as the Theory of Evolution. By contrast, whenever Newton’s rule regarding gravity was used, it was to be called Newton’s Law of Gravitation. Law, good. Theory? Notsomuch.

This is demoralizing for us physicists since it can lead to misunderstanding about what science can and cannot do. After thinking about this for many years I have reached a set of conclusions about the Nature of Science1\nJust to be clear…it is after all my blog 😎 … I’ll not use the word “Law” when I describe scientific ideas.\n\nWait. What about Newton’s Laws of motion?  Glad you asked. I will talk about historical scientific ideas which got labeled as “Law” but I’ll use “law.” So: Newton’s Second law.

In everyday life, I might toss off a thought casually, without preparation or much analysis. You know, like in a normal conversation. But a scientific statement isn’t like that. It’s considered, it’s carefully put together, it’s thoughtful and meaningful. A scientific statement can be a sentence, or a whole book.

    "text": "2 It is not possible to test a theory. We test models.\nI’ve discarded Laws and truth and proof and so it’s time to confront the idea of a theory and how we can trust one or not. “What is a theory,” is a valid question.\n\n2.1 Planes, Trains, and Automobiles: Models\nWhen I was a kid, I was consumed by models of cars— “hot rods” of the 1960s. And airplanes. And HO train sets. In short, life-like replicas of transportation tools were my passion when I wasn’t playing or watching baseball.\nA plastic model stands for—represents—a real thing in the world, not perfectly, but well enough to complete a mission. In my case, that mission was a 13 year old boy imagining the car that he’d work on and own some day. If my plastic 1967 Chevy with baby moon wheels, GM 350 cubes with aluminum heads, Edelbrock intake manifold, Holley 4bbl, HPC Coated Headers w/Dual Exhaust, painted baby blue was made more and more precise, it would eventually become…a real car.\nchevybox.png intage Revell model ’57 Chevy. In the box.\nI’ve been careful in what I wrote above to do two things. First, I referred to scientific statements and models of nature. Gone are the days when a physicist can construct a mathematical description of say a block of wood sliding down a plane of wood and proudly proclaim that what’s written in symbols on paper is a 1:1 faithful reproduction of what happens in the laboratory.\nNow we operate from a more hazy, removed vantage point. As we get into electric and magnetic fields, relativity, and quantum mechanics the correspondence between a mathematical description and what nature is supposed to be like will become necessarily more indirect and abstract.\nI now tend to think of a theory as a broad framework within which there are many ways to address nature from within the framework. But what we don’t do is test the theory, rather we build mathematical models that use the rules (from within the framework) of a theory to address a particular, well-defined piece of nature with predictions. Then experiments are done to test the model, not the theory.\nLet’s pick on Special Relativity again. I can tell you the Theory of Relativity in these three lines:\n\nThe rules of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nThe interval between two spacetime events is Minkowskian.\n\nThe first two statements are called the Postulates of Relativity and the last statement is a consequence of the mathematization of the theory in geometry.\nThis is the Theory of Relativity…the framework within which any scientific statement must fit. You don’t need to understand what these sentences mean, but you can surely see that they don’t contain a single mathematic equation. That’s where the models come in.\nIn my way of thinking, a mathematical model of nature is a little machine that you a result at the end when you add some information at the beginning. The result can be, and usually is, the prediction of what an experiment would find. That result can also be another equation, distilled from input equations.\nWe will use the Theory of Relativity above quite a bit, but our confrontation with nature will be through models that are built within the framework of the Theory of Relativity.\nAn important aspect of a model is that it must respect a possible measurement’s capabilities. A model is not meant to be a 1:1 representation of nature, just like the model car is not a real car. It’s a limited representation that can be tested. Here’s what I mean.\nI can create a model for how fast a block will move across a table if it’s pushed with a given force. If that’s all I want to know, that’s a pretty easy thing to predict. But notice that it’s not the whole story of what goes on. The table and the block heat up and so energy is lost to the warming air. There are billions of little, complex atomic bonds between the under-surface of the block and the table-top. There’s a lot of physics involved in describing this event and how much detail I include in the model depends on a) what I want to know from my measurement and b) how well I need to know it. My model could include all of those thermodynamic and atomic effects but I wouldn’t include them if I can’t measure the speed very precisely.\nPhysicists learn to stick to the Goldilocks Rule of Modeling. A model can’t be too crude and a model can’t be too precise…a model needs to be Just Right.\nTo summarize:\n\naccept a theory and its rules; build mathematical models within the theory to represent nature (but not in a 1:1 sense);\nmake predictions from those models and test them in experiments;\naccept or reject the model based on the results of the experiments.\n\nThat’s the game that I’ve played for four decades in which I’ve never left the theory of quantum mechanics, the theory of special relativity, nor the theory of general relativity…but I’ve tested lots of models.\n\n2.1.1 Statements\nIt’s a detail, but an important one. We cannot test nature directly. We can only assess the truth or falsity only of statements. This reflects a remoteness of a scientist relative to nature itself. So a prediction and a test of that prediction is really testing statements and not theories and not nature. I confess this is hard to appreciate and I can probably argue even with myself about it.\npainting.png In some ways, what an artist does when she paints a landscape is make a model of it. Representation theory is a serious part of “Semiotics” which is a sophisticated discipline in philosophy, linguistics, and aesthetics.\n\n\n\n2.2 Memory Medicine: Confirmation and Disconfirmation\nIn my car I just heard an advertisement for a supplement that would make me remember things better. (I don’t remember its name…see what I did there?) It apparently has been “proven” to be effective. Well, by now you know my problems with that word, but what is it that scientists can actually say about a model and indirectly, the theory framework within which it functions?\nThe black squirrel issue makes it clear that proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that an inductive model is true is risky and historically unproductive.\n\nThe word that we use when evidence supports a model’s prediction is “confirm”…the model’s prediction is confirmed, definately not “proved.”\nThe word we use when a model’s prediction is contradicted is “disconfirmed.”\nThe burden of any model is that it must be “falsifiable” or in principle be disconfirmable.\n\nA couple of notes. “Confirm” is weaker than prove, leaving us the necessary freedom to allow that evidence can change our models and even theories. Those theories that I keep saying we trust? They have been confirmed many, many times. (It’s fair to think that maybe a Law is just a really, well-confirmed theory. But I’m fighting that older picture of Newtonian-like Laws.)\nThat last bullet is important and has a special place in the Philosophy of Science—and is the center of a couple of serious arguments in my fields of physics right now.\n\nYou might have heard some of this in the news and the falsifiability test of a theory (the word used then) is attributed to the philosopher, Karl Popper. He thought this was a worthy goal of science because showing something to be wrong is actually a deductive process, the inverse of showing that something agrees.\n\nTo a Popperian (my pejorative word) a single instance of disconfirmation should eliminate a model from study (they would say “theory”). A single black squirrel? That’s nice sounding, but not how science actually works and is philosophically troublesome (ask Mr Google about the Duhem–Quine thesis)–that black squirrel could have just been in a dust-bin.\n\nThe requirement of falsifiability as a standard required of science has pretty much stuck with us.\n\nCan you see how this in-principle falsifiability requirement actually feeds my original assertion above about how to tell if a statement is scientific or not? The latter is just a simpler version of the former.\nThe bottom line here is this:\n\nThe burden on science is not to prove things about nature, but to confirm or disconfirm statements about nature.\n\nIn QS&BB, we’ll watch revolutions in science that create large frameworks in which models are tested, rejected, and accepted. These frameworks I will call theories and I can list them for you:\n\nNewton’s laws of motion (remember?)\nNewton’s law of Gravitation\nMaxwell’s Theory of Electromagnetism\nQuantum Mechanics\nSpecial Relativity Theory\nThe General Theory of Relativity\n\nIn my picture, there are not many theories in physics.\nOther topics like the big bang? quarks? nuclear physics? the standard model of particle physics? These are all models within the currently acceptable theories (frameworks) of 4, 5, and 6 above. Numbers 1 and 2? They’ve been replaced!\n\n\n2.3 Laziness: Belief\nOne more word that both has no place in science but is one of those words we use all the time: Belief. We all talk about what we believe (and don’t), and scientists will sometimes colloquially do that in a scientific context, but that’s sloppy. When I say “I believe in X,” what I really mean is that that job that word does is act as a shorthand for the sentence: “X is highly confirmed by experiments and X is likely to survive foreseeable experimental tests if asked.” If I’m an expert in the field of X, then I have the obligation to describe those experimental tests. If I’m not an expert in X and I want to echo an expert’s “belief,” I should expect that expert could also enumerate its experimental successes in detail on my behalf. (That’s a little tricky.)\nThere are dos and don’ts here for scientists (and students of science). When it comes to belief in a scientific statement, I can’t do three things:\n\nI can’t say that I believe in X because I want to,\nI can’t say that I believe in X because my gut or a “feeling” suggests that I should, and\nI can’t say that I believe in X because just because a non-expert or an authoritative text tells me to. Likewise, I can’t say that I don’t believe in X for any of those same three reasons."

The Nobel physicist from the University of Texas, Stephen Weinberg is both a prolific scientist, but also a writer of non-specialist books, the most famous being The First Three Minutes. One of his later books for the public is Dreams of a Final Theory and his last chapter is called Against Philosophy where he notes, “I know how philosophers feel about attempts by scientists at amateur philosophy. But I do not aim here to play the role of a philosopher, but rather that of a specimen, an unregenerate working scientist who finds no help in professional philosophy. I am not alone in this; I know of no one who has participated actively in the advance of physics in the postwar period whose research has been significantly helped by the work of philosophers.”\nOne of the more disturbing ways in which philosophy of science has drifted is in the denial of the project of science as learning about the physical world.

    "text": "2 What’s the smallest thing we can know about?\n\n2.1 The inside for my grandparents.\nFor people of my grandparents’ generation, the sophisticated answer would be “what you can see.” I was born in the year 1950, and so my grandparents were children at the dawn of the 20th century which is when physics got interesting. They would have been taught that if you can’t see it, then it can’t be real. To claim otherwise would be absurd. Chemists spoke of atoms, but were disdainful of anyone who thought they were real. They were just a shorthand picture for how to visualize elements. Physicists were even less flexible.\n\n\n2.2 The inside for my parents.\nFor people of my parents’ generation, the answer would have been “protons, neutrons, and electrons.” The atom had been thrust into believability around the turn of the century, and then refined during the next two decades. But the neat planet-like picture of the atom was where it all stopped for many.\n\n\n2.3 The inside …for us!\nIn our generation, the answer to the “smallest” question has been “quarks and leptons” …but we fully expect that they are not the end of the “smallest” story. We’re hard at work, even as we speak with brand new tools to explore further than ever before.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a computer reconstruction of the collision of two protons at the Large Hadron Collider. The ATLAS experiment is one of two gargantian ‘detectors’ that catches the debris from these energetic collisions. The figure shows how two quarks in each of the colliding protons bounce off from one another and emerge in two collimated ‘jets’ of debris as they rip through the detector. The view is from the side and the lengths of these jets is each about 30 feet long. The length that the colliding quarks probed is about 0.000000000000000018 meters. This is today’s answer to the ‘how small’ question.\n\n\n\nMaybe in your generation? The sky’s the limit! We’ve hints at solving some old puzzles and we’ll undoubtedly find new ones. We’re developing and deploying amazing new instruments and theoretical ideas now rub shoulders with not just nature, but philosophy and the deepest questions asked by humans. Your generation is going to see amazing things.\nThrough decades of intense experimentation and imaginative theorizing, the tiniest bits of reality are turning out to be a fascinating collection of objects. In the 1950s and 1960s, we just stood back and tried to catch the hundreds of particles that our experiments spit out at us. New particles every year! Names that nobody could remember. Hundreds of them, which was ludicrous! Didn’t nature have some plan?\n\n“Quarks”? “Leptons”? Lots of jargon and I’ll keep it all straight for you as we go along.For now, quarks are itsy-bitsy pieces of the proton and leptons include the electron and others. New states of matter might be: “additional quarks, the Higgs Boson, Supersymmetric Particles, Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), Dark Matter particles…” all famous candidates for future discovery. Of course whenever we get too cocky, nature plots to surprise us with something completely unexpected—more often than we’d like to admit! So, we’re instinctively wary of being too sure of what’s coming.\n\nThe good news is that we’ve uncovered a model that’s a very good picture of how much of the fundamental particles of the universe work together and we’ve been exploring it since the 1970s. We’ve knitted that earlier mess together into a coherent picture of the entities themselves as well as the rules that govern how that stuff behaves. But we’re unhappy. Our grand synthesis of the Tiniest Bits Story—called the Standard Model — needs some polishing. Or more. While it’s been the gold-standard of the successful scientific theory, we expect that new tiny bits are lurking in our experiments and we will be astonished if nothing shows up as we dig deeper. This new anticipation would have been met with blank stares only a couple of decades ago.\nSo much for the inside effort."

    "text": "3 Okay. So what’s the biggest real thing you can know about?\n\n3.1 The outside for my grandparents.\nFor people of my grandparents’ generation the learned answer to this question would be “the size of the Milky Way,” which they would have been taught constituted the whole universe. Everything visible in the night sky was thought to be a part of one big, but still cozy cluster of stars which we see to be densest around the southern sky (from North America). Not only was my grandparents’ universe compact, it was supposed to be permanent—static and unchanging— built of three kinds of objects: planets, stars, and clusters of stars. Stars twinkled, planets were steadfastly bright, and clusters of stars were fuzzy, indicative of their presumed distances from us. Sure, they all moved with regularity during each night and shifted slightly in a year, but the large scale structure of my grandparents’ universe was simple: a nice, intimate, dependable universe.\n\n\n3.2 The outside for my parents.\nFor people of my parents’ generation, the universe suddenly became huge. Those fuzzy clusters were found to be other galaxies outside of the Milky Way which are surprisingly far from us—we’re not alone in our comfy galaxy. They were taught about thousands—we now know, billions—of others, of which the Milky Way is a relatively modest and ordinary example.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, a compilation of hundreds of days of observation of a single dime-sized patch on the sky in the constellation, Fornax. Every spot is a galaxy, some nearby and some at the edge of our ability to see.\n\n\n\nThis is the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, a compilation of hundreds of days of observation of a single dime-sized patch on the sky in the constellation, Fornax. Every spot is a galaxy, some nearby and some at the edge of our ability to see. ```\nIn this remarkable galactic family photograph the youngest galaxy imaged is 13.2 billion years old. We see it as it was when its light left its surface, on the way to the Hubble’s camera. It’s also a time when the universe was much smaller than it is now. This picture is today’s answer to the “biggest thing” question.\n\n\n3.3 The outside for us.\nBut, the real shocker was the overthrow of the static universe of my grandparents era. My parents’ universe was found to be flying apart—expanding—at a breakneck speed. No longer a tight-knit, stable thing…the universe is now huge and reckless. The really unsettling piece of news for my generation is that the Big Questions of antiquity are now legitimate scientific research programs: Was there a beginning to the universe? Are we alone? Will the universe end? Are there other universes? Was there anything before The Beginning? What drives the expansion of our universe to accelerate? The outside crowd thinks big thoughts now and this is a development of only the last couple of decades.\nWhen I was in graduate school, a professor told me that Cosmology was “physics knitting.” Not any more! Cosmology in my and especially your generation is going to be flat-out amazing!\n\nAn Auspicious Beginning\n\nYes. The observable universe had a beginning, and quite a beginning it must have been: it was a roiling mess of radiation and elementary particles at temperatures never to be seen again. Everything that is—space, time, and all of energy—would have been confined into a size smaller than a baseball. Unthinkably dense and with growth that was stunningly rapid, our early universe defies imagination. It’s so outrageous that comprehending it seems a job for fiction and not science, yet my generation has also found ways to explore it: we probe it through direct telescope observations and we remake it in particle collisions. This is the blending of the outside with the inside pictures that motivates me.\n\nWait. I don’t believe in the big bang. You appear to, but isn’t what you think just another “belief”? Aren’t we each entitled to our own beliefs?  Glad you asked. “Belief” is a tricky word that we all use, although in our context, we should be clear and I’ll try to do that in the next lesson."

We’re deep into the story—the plot is well understood, the characters are developed, and a “can’t put it down” fever has set in. We’re eager to see how it comes out. I work on one (big!) experiment but there are many dozens of experiments involving thousands of us all around the globe — and in orbit above the globe and in deep underground laboratories inside of the globe — to push ourselves to the story’s climax."
