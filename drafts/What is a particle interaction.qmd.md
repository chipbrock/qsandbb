# What is a particle interaction?

## 1000 feet

When any atoms, nuclei, or elementary particles encounter one another they might "interact." They might bounce off one another and continue on their way or they might crash into one another and become entirely different states of matter...or something in-between.

In this way of thinking, when you look at at your shoe there are a variety of interactions involved. Visible rays of light – natural or artificial – bounce off the surface of your shoe and reflect into your eye where it bangs into your  cornea and interacts – absorbed, creating electrical impuses (electrons) which further interact in the cells of your visual cortex. Lots of interactions are a part of your life.
