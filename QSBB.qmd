title: "about QS&BB"
---

This site is called *Quarks, Spacetime, and the Big Bang* (aka QS&BB), which is an umbrella phrase that covers all of my research in  elementary particle physics and the last 20 years of my teaching which has been for non-science students at Michigan State University. 

The site, QS&BB, is a continuation of that teaching and is a repackaging of my courses' content from classical and contemporary topics in relativity, quantum mechanics, particle physics, and cosmology. Like the courses, I've prepared this for a non-specialist audience (is that you?) and I hope you'll enjoy the stories, and the pedagogy and learn something new with each post. The two home-grown courses are:

- *Quarks, Spacetime, and the Big Bang* (MSU ISP220), which pretty much gives away its focus in the name.
-  *Navigating the Universe* (MSU ISP213), a chronological history of physics and art, a course designed for MSU honors students.

So the blog attached to QS&BB is my way of teaching in a new way.  I'll bring topics from my courses to the public, along with insights from my 50 years of research at Fermilab in Illinois and CERNâ€™s Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland.
