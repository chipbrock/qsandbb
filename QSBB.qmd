> ℹ️ README. *Quarks, Spacetime, and the Big Bang* (aka **QS&BB**), is an umbrella phrase that covers all of my research in elementary particle physics. It's also the name of a course I created for non-science students at Michigan State University.



This site a continuation of that teaching...a repackaging of my course content from classical and contemporary topics in relativity, quantum mechanics, particle physics, and cosmology.

> **Wait.** What’s that logo about? <br> **Glad you asked.** Above the horizon is the sky as it would appear to you if you had microwave vision and shows the difference in temperature across the sky. It's a baby picture of the universe taken when it only a few thousand of its 14 billion years old. Isn't it cute? Below the horizon is a computer reconstruction of a proton-proton collision in my experiment, ATLAS, at the Large Hadron Collider at the international CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. I'll talk *a lot* about what goes on here!

We'll talk about what what both images mean, but I'll mention here that the difference in the sky between red and blue? 1 part in 100,000 of a degree. Very smooth. Which is nice. But it's also a problem. We'll see.

I've prepared this site for a non-specialist audience (is that you?) and I hope you'll enjoy the stories, and the pedagogy and learn something new with each post.

The site, "**QS&BB**" is a collection of blog posts, which I call "stories" and is my way of teaching. I tell stories.
