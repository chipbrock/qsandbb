I’m an experimental particle physicist at Michigan State University, and I’ve benefited from the U.S. public’s support for my research over the past 50 years. Teaching these topics—especially to non-science students—has been one way to give back, and now I’m bringing these ideas to a broader audience beyond the lecture hall.

BTW, it's confusing having two names.

 
All my life I've been "Chip," although my driver's license says "Raymond." Before you ask, nobody claims to know where this started. Please note before being really proud of yourself: "Chip off the old Brock" is not new, it's not funny anymore, and all of you think you were the first to invent it...
